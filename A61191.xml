            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope and expect, That as thoſe <hi>Feet</hi> have been <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi> that brought you the <hi>Retail</hi>-tidings of your <hi>expiring</hi> Warfare; ſo that <hi>Hand</hi> that ſhall tranſmit the <hi>Series</hi> of them to your view, ſhall not want his due proportion of benevolous acceptance.</p>

            <p>You may not expect here an Hiſtory, <hi>beginning</hi> with our late unhappy Wars; but (that which is better) it <hi>ends</hi> with them, (For, <hi>better is the latter end of a thing,</hi> ſayes Solomon, <hi>then the beginning.</hi>) And therefore this Peece (though <hi>laſt acted,</hi> yet) being <hi>firſt intended</hi> in Providence, may well be firſt committed to Hiſtory, as containing <hi>that Point,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, as into its <hi>Center,</hi> all the <hi>former</hi> Actions did <hi>thruſt;</hi> If any have a ſtory of them to bring forth, this doth not at all <hi>prevent,</hi> but <hi>prepare</hi> for it.

            <p>For the firſt, I may ſay of the Actions of this <hi>Army,</hi> in a good proportion of truth, what was ſaid in another caſe: If they had been all <hi>largely</hi> expreſſed, <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Volume</hi> could not have <hi>contained</hi> them: For as in <hi>populous Cities,</hi> eſpecially if of great <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>trading,</hi> Houſes are <hi>thwackt</hi> together
<pb facs="tcp:66403:7"/> without thoſe liberties of <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Orchards,</hi> which <hi>Country villages</hi> are accommodated with: Even ſo, in the Story of this ARMY, into which ſo many great and <hi>glorious</hi> actions, and <hi>births</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> have throng'd, to make it rich and glorious by the <hi>mutuall projections</hi> of their Lights; you cannot expect to have ſuch <hi>Elbow-room</hi> of <hi>Expreſsion,</hi> and <hi>Accommodation</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> as in more <hi>ſingle</hi> ſtories. Or as <hi>leſſer Lights</hi> ſhining in an <hi>Orbe</hi> by <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſeem <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>ſpecious,</hi> and of <hi>greater</hi> magnitude then <hi>bigger ſtarres</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations:</hi> Even ſo, How many of theſe Actions, were <hi>each</hi> of them improved and extended by the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> ſpread in their juſt breadth, the Folds of their particular Circumſtances, opened, would make ſo many <hi>competent</hi> Stories by <hi>themſelves.</hi>

               <p>SIr THOMAS FAIRFAX, eldeſt Son of the Lord FAIRFAX, of <hi>Denton</hi> in the County of <hi>York:</hi> Martially diſpoſed from his youth; Not finding action ſuitable to him in his own Country, (for through the great goodneſſe and long ſuffering of God, <hi>England</hi> hath been a quiet habitation theſe 80 years) And there being imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Holland,</hi> he went over thither to enable himſelf in military experience: And upon his return into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66403:15"/> he matched into a moſt Noble and Martial family, taking to Wife one of the Daughters of that ever Renowned <hi>General,</hi> the Lord VERE. And thus the Reader may take notice, how not only his Extraction, Diſpoſition, and Education beſpake him for a <hi>Souldier,</hi> but his Contract alſo portended nothing leſſe. Albeit, ſo far was he from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating ſuch a condition of his Country, when he ſaw it like to need the exerciſe of his faculty; that he moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely offered the firſt attempts of his reſolved Minde at the Altar of <hi>Peace.</hi> When at the <hi>King's</hi> firſt endeavours to raiſe a Guard for his own perſon, at <hi>York;</hi> apprehended then by thoſe parts, and found quickly after to be the beginning of an <hi>Army:</hi> He was entruſted by his Country to preferre a Petition to His Majeſty; the ſcope whereof was, to beſeech him to hearken to his Parliament, and not to take that courſe of raiſing Forces, he was then engaging in: which Petition the King refuſing, he preſt with that inſtance and intention, following the <hi>King</hi> ſo cloſe therewith in the field, called <hi>Heyworth Moor,</hi> in the preſence of 80. if not 100000. people of the County (the like appearance was hardly ever ſeen in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>) ſo cloſe, I ſay, til at laſt he tendred the ſame upon the pomel of his ſaddle. But finding no Propitiatory here, and ſeeing a War could not be avoided, he early paid the vowes of his Martial dedication; And ſo ſoon as theſe unhappy troubles brake forth, took a Commiſsion under his Father, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> L. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> (whoſe timely appearance and gallant performances for his country in the North, deſerves a ſtory by it ſelf;) And ſerved the <hi>Parliament</hi> in lower Commands, then what Providence ſince hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged his capacity and merit unto, making him now <hi>General</hi> of the Parliaments forces; to which truſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he was preferred upon no other grounds, than the obſervation of his Valour, and all anſwerable abilities for the ſame, teſtified in many notable ſervices done by him in the North, whileſt he was yet in a lower ſphere. And now how delightfully remarkable is it (as a moſt apt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of providence) if God ſhall make him, who was by

Notwithſtanding they were fruſtrated in their end: By reaſon that ſome few dayes before, the Enemy divided themſelves; one party of their horſe and foot, with ſome peeces of cannon, skirmiſhing with the other in ſight of the town, but, only with powder; to make the Town believe (as they gave out) that the Parliaments forces, who were comming to relieve them, were there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred and beaten; hoping by this ſtratagem to have drawn a Party out of the Town to their friends ſuccour, and ſo to have cut them off by an ambuſcado. But God turned this wiſdome of the enemy into fooliſhneſſe; the beſieged kept cloſe to their works; the Enemies returning from their mock-chaſe, fell to firing the Town with their granadoes and mortar-peeces, whereby two long ſtreets of the town, of fair buildings, were burnt to the ground; and withall they ſtormed moſt furiouſly. But they met with a gallant Commander in chief, Col. <hi>Blake,</hi> &amp; as valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that gave them ſuch ſhowres of Lead, as filled the Trenches with their dead carkaſes: And that which adds to the mercy, the Town, in all, from the beginning to the raiſing of the ſiege, had not loſt 200 men. Towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a party of horſe were ſent, who approached to the very works, (for the Enemy had drawn off their guns, and their Rear was upon their march) And the Town thereupon being confirmed of the approach of their friends to their relief, ſallied out and fell upon the rear of the Enemy, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome, and took others priſoners. The whole Body

The <hi>General</hi> in his march turned out of the way, to ſee the ſiege before <hi>Boſtol-houſe,</hi> where Major-General <hi>Skippon,</hi> according to order, had that morning made ſome attempt, but the ſucceſſe was not according to our deſires (the Moat being much deeper then we expected.) This night, at the Head quarter, intelligence came that the King was marching from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> towards <hi>Daventry,</hi> with intention to raiſe the ſiege at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as was conceived; which was by order before done to his hand.</p>

It happened moſt remarkably, in the houſe of one who expreſſed no good affection to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and denyed to furniſh thoſe conveniences for quarter, (affirming that he had them not,) which afterwards by occaſion of the fire, he was enforced to bring out. The next day, <hi>Iune</hi> 7. the Army marched to <hi>Sherrington,</hi> a mile Eaſt of <hi>Newport-Pagnel,</hi> to the end the Forces with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Vermuden</hi> (who upon the Scots retreat to <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> were recalled, and upon their march back) might more conveniently joyn, but eſpecially to be on that ſide the River, the better to ſecure the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> in caſe the <hi>King,</hi> who the day before had faced <hi>Northhampton,</hi> and ſeemed to intend that way, ſhould attempt to break into it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it appeared they did not conſult their ſafety and quarter on the back of a gariſon, as without incurring any great cenſure they might have done; but rather conſulted their honour and the publick ſervice. Expreſſes were ſent to Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwel</hi> into the Aſsociation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him whereabout our Army was, that in caſe the Aſsociation were in danger, he might know how to joyn with us. Lords day, <hi>Iune</hi> 8. the Army reſting in their quarters, ſeverall parties of horſe were ſent out as far as <hi>Toceſter,</hi> to gain intelligence of the motions of the <hi>Kings</hi> Army, who brought in ſome priſoners of Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdales</hi> Brigade, from whom information was gathered that the Kings Army continued ſtill about <hi>Daventry:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>General</hi> called a Councel of War, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the beſt way to engage the Enemy. Where taking into conſideration of what uſe Lieutenant-General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66403:25"/> would be to them in a time of ſo great action: The <hi>General</hi> propounded to the Councel of War, and it was by them unanimouſly conſented unto, that a Letter ſhould be writ to the Parliament, to deſire that they would pleaſe for a time to diſpence with L. Gen. <hi>Cromwels</hi> abſence from the Houſe; and to give way he might command their Horſe, there being like to be very ſpeedily an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which Letter was ſent by Colonel <hi>Hamond,</hi> who went Poſt the ſame day to the Parliament, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly returned with an anſwer according as was deſired, to the great content of the <hi>General,</hi> and the whole Army.</p>
               <p>This day, Colonel <hi>Vermuden,</hi> who the day before was with his party of Horſe returned, and come near to the quarters of the army, himſelf came to the <hi>General,</hi> deſiring (in regard of ſome ſpeciall occaſions which he ſaid he had to draw him beyond ſeas) that he might have leave to lay down his Commiſsion, which was yielded unto, and accordingly he received his diſcharge. At this dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Major-General <hi>Skippon</hi> was deſired to draw the form of a battell: and at the ſame time the Army was divided into ſeverall Brigades of Horſe and Foot, in order to their being better diſpoſed for an engagement. The <hi>General,</hi> though not depending upon multitudes, yet ſerving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the uſe of all good means; ſent one Poſt after another to Sir <hi>Iohn Gel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Roſsiter,</hi> to the Governours of <hi>Coventry, Warwick, Northhampton,</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> To march with all ſpeed with their Forces to the Army, for that there was likely to be ſpeedily an engagement with the Enemy. In the mean, the Army neglected no time, but on Wedneſday, <hi>Iune</hi> 11, though a rainy day, marched from <hi>Stony-Stratford</hi> to <hi>Wootton,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Northampton,</hi> where intelligence ſtill confirmed the <hi>Kings</hi> continuance at <hi>Daventry,</hi> quartering all his Foot and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages upon <hi>Burrough-hill;</hi> a place of great advantage (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly been an ancient fortification) and making ſhow, as if he had choſen that place to fight upon, in caſe we durſt advance to him. But afterwards it appeared, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66403:26"/> his ſtay there, was only till a part of 1200 horſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, which he had ſent from his Army to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as a convoy with the plundered cattel &amp; ſheep of <hi>Leiceſterſhire, Northamptonſhire,</hi> &amp;c. the better to enable <hi>Oxford</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſiege, in caſe it ſhould be attempted again in his abſence, himſelf being intent upon a march for the relief of <hi>Pomfract</hi> and <hi>Scarborough;</hi> which he then apprehended to have ſmal difficulty in it, underſtanding the removall of the Scotiſh army.</p>
               <p>The Army being come to <hi>Wotton,</hi> they found there none of the beſt accommodation for quarter; only, what was wanting that way, was kindly and reſpectively endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſupplied by the Major and Magiſtrates of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> who the ſame night came to the <hi>General</hi> at the head quarter, upon the errand of a congratulatory viſit and preſent. The next day, the Army marched to <hi>Gilsborough,</hi> (four miles on the weſt of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and within five miles of <hi>Burrough-hill,</hi> where the Enemy ſtill continued) Marching in very good order; for that they did advance directly upon the place where the enemy had pitcht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A commanded party of horſe gave the Enemy an alarm, and took ſome priſoners, by whom they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>King</hi> was a hunting, the Souldiers in no order, and their horſes all at graſſe, having not the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our advance, and being in the greateſt ſecurity that could be; but the alarum was ſo quickly taken through all their quarters, that our Foot being ſomewhat behind, and night approaching, it was not thought wiſdome to make any further attempt. About twelve that night, the <hi>General</hi> took horſe, and rode about both the Horſe and Foot guards, till four in the morning (expecting the Enemy would have ſhewn ſome gallantry that night, and fallen upon ſome of his quarters, as he had hindred them in their ſport at hunting the day before.) In the very entrance whereof this hard condition befell the General himſelf; That having forgot the Word, he was ſtopped at the firſt Guard; and requiring the Souldier that ſtood Sentinel, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66403:26"/> give it him, he refuſed to do it, telling him, he was to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> the Word from all that paſt him, but to <hi>give</hi> it to none; and ſo made the General ſtand in the wet, till he ſent for the Captain of the guard to receive his commiſsion to give the General the word, (In ſuch ſubjection are the Higheſt, to thoſe lawes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rſt derived their ſanction and authority in great part from themſelves) and in the end the Souldier was rewarded for his duty and carefulneſſe, (as it was interpreted.) As the <hi>General</hi> was riding in the morning about three of the clock, within a mile and half of <hi>Flowre,</hi> where the Enemy kept an horſe-guard; He could diſcern the Enemy riding faſt over <hi>Burrough-hill,</hi> to make fires in abundance, as if they were firing their Huts; which gave ſome cauſe to believe they were about to march, as indeed it proved afterwards. For,</p>
               <p>About five in the morning, <hi>Iune</hi> 13. the General being returned to the head-quarter, the Scoutmaſter gen. <hi>Watſon</hi> (whoſe continued diligence in getting timely intelligence of the Enemies motion, then, and alwayes, redounded not a little to the enablement of the Army) brought him certain notice, that the Enemy was drawing off from <hi>Burrough-hill;</hi> had ſtood in arms all night, and were all amazed that our Army was ſo neer; it being ſpread abroad in their army we were gone for ſecurity into the <hi>Aſſociation;</hi> And four or five more of the Spies came one after another, confirming the ſame intelligence, adding further, that moſt of their carriages were drawn from <hi>Burrough-hill</hi> towards <hi>Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi> And indeed, the Convoy of horſe being returned from <hi>Oxford</hi> the night before, and this unexpected march of the Army cloſe up to them, being in a manner a ſurpriſe of them; cauſed them ſpeedily to reſolve upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned march towards <hi>Pomfract;</hi> either judging, the Army would not follow them, or if they did, they ſhould be able to fight us at more advantage, after they had drawn us further Northward.</p>
               <p>About ſix of the clock in the morning, a Councel of War was called, to conſider what attempt to make upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66403:27"/> he Enemy. In the middeſt of the debate, came in Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> out of the Aſsociation, with 600 Horſe and Dragoons, who was with the greateſt joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>General</hi> and the whole army. Inſtantly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given for Drums to beat, Trumpets to ſound to horſe, and all our army to draw to a rendezvouz; from whence a good party of Horſe were ſent towards <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> under the command of Major <hi>Harriſon,</hi> (of whoſe continued fidelity the Publique hath had ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) to bring further intelligence of the Enemies moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and another ſtrong party of Horſe was ſent under under the command of Colonel <hi>Ireton,</hi> to fall upon the flank of the Enemy, if he ſaw cauſe: and the main body of our Army marched to flank the Enemy in the way to <hi>Harborough,</hi> and came that night to <hi>Gilling;</hi> the Countrey much rejoycing at our comming, having been miſerably plundered by the Enemy; and ſome having had their children taken from them, and ſold before their faces to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of that Army, whom the parents were enforced to redeem with the price of money. That evening we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the Van of the Enemies army was at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> the Rear within two miles of <hi>Naſeby:</hi> and no ſooner was the <hi>General</hi> got to his quarters, but tidings was brought him of the good ſervice done by Colonel <hi>Ireton,</hi> in falling into the Enemies quarters, which they had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up in <hi>Naſeby</hi> Town; where he took many priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſome of the Princes Life-guard, and <hi>Langdales</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, and gave a ſound alarm throughout the Enemies army (the confidence of the Enemy in poſſeſsing theſe quarters, grounded upon their ſlight eſteem of this Army, and want of intelligence, was very remarkable.) Upon this alarm, the <hi>King</hi> (not having notice of it till eleven at night, as he had little imagined the nearneſſe of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or that they durſt bear up to him) much amazed, left his own quarters at that unſeaſonable time; and for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity went to <hi>Harborough,</hi> where Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> quartered; and ſo ſoon as he came thither, ſent to call up his Nephew,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66403:27"/> (reſting himſelf in a chair, in a low-room, in the mean time) who preſently aroſe; a Councel of War was called: the queſtion was put, What was beſt to be done ſeeing our Army was ſo neer, and as they then perceived fully inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ingage them. It was conſidered by them, that ſhould they march on to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> if the Rear were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the whole Army might be put in hazard; and there was no marching with the Van unleſſe they could bring the Rear clear off, which they diſcerned to be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Whereupon it was reſolved to give battell, taking themſelves (as indeed they were) for a more conſiderable force then we, eſpecially in Horſe, on which they chiefly depended; being alſo as confident, they might relye upon their Infantry for valiant reſolute men; &amp; they reſolved (as appeared) not to abide in that place till we marched up to them, but in a gallant bravery to ſeek us out. Herein the Kings Counſel prevailed againſt the minde of the moſt of his great Officers, who were of opinion, that it was beſt to avoid fighting.</p>
               <p>Saturday <hi>Iune</hi> 14. The <hi>General</hi> with the Army advanced by three of the clock in the morning, from <hi>Gilling</hi> towards <hi>Naſeby,</hi> with an intention to follow cloſe upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and (if poſsible) retard their march with our Horſe, till our foot could draw up to them, in caſe they ſhould have marched on to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (the intelligence being, that they had drawn ſome of their Carriages in the night through <hi>Harborough</hi>) that way. By five in the morning, the Army was at a Rendezvouz near <hi>Naſeby,</hi> where his Excellency received intelligence by our Spies, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was at <hi>Harborough;</hi> with this further, that it was ſtill doubtfull, whether he meant to march away, or to ſtand us. But immediately the doubt was reſolved: great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Enemies horſe were diſcerned on the top of the hill on this ſide <hi>Harborough,</hi> which increaſing more and more in our view, begat a confidence in the <hi>General,</hi> and the reſidue of the Officers that he meant not to draw away, as ſome imagined, but that he was putting his Army in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66403:28"/> order, either there to receive us, or to come to us, to engage us upon the ground we ſtood: whilſt the <hi>General</hi> was thus obſerving the countenance of the Enemy, directions were given to put the Army into ſuch a poſture, as that if the Enemy came on, we might take the advantage of our ground, and be in readineſſe to receive him; or if not, that we might advance towards him. And whileſt theſe things were in conſultation and action, the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which before was the greateſt part of it out of our view, by reaſon of the Hill that interpoſed, we ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing in order towards us: and the winde blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat Weſtwardly, by the Enemies advance ſo much on their right hand, it was evident, that he deſigned to get the winde of us: which occaſioned the <hi>General</hi> to draw down into a large fallow field on the Northweſt ſide of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> flanked on the left hand with a hedge, which was a convenient place for us to fight the Enemy in. And indeed ſeeing his reſolution to advance upon us, we took the beſt advantage we could of the ground, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsing the ledge of a Hill, running from Eaſt to Weſt; upon which our Army being drawn up, fronted towards the Enemy. But conſidering it might be of advantage to us to draw up our Army out of ſight of the Enemy; who marched upon a plain ground towards us: we retreated about an 100 paces from the ledge of the Hill, that ſo the Enemy might not perceive in what form our battell was drawn, nor ſee any confuſion therein, and yet we to ſee the form of their battell; to which we could conform our ſelves for advantages, and recover the advantage of the Hill when we pleaſed, which accordingly we did. The Enemy perceiving this retreat, thought (as ſince they have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) we were drawing off to avoid fighting (and juſt then it was brought to the King, that our Army was flying to <hi>Northhampton</hi>) which did occaſion them the more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate; for they made ſo much haſte, that they left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Ordnance behinde them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>General,</hi> together with the <hi>Major-General,</hi> put the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66403:28"/> ſeverall Brigades of Foot into order: having committed the Ordering of the Horſe to Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who did obtain from the <hi>General,</hi> That ſeeing the Horſe were neere 6000. and were to bee fought in two wings; His Excellency would pleaſe to make Col. <hi>Ireton</hi> Commiſſary gen. of horſe, and appoint him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Left wing, that day; the command of the Right wing being as much as the <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> could apply himſelf unto. Which being granted by the <hi>General,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> aſsigned him five Regiments of Horſe, a Diviſion of 200 Horſe of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> for that Wing; and the Dragoons to line the forementioned hedge, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the enemy from annoying the Left flank of the Army. In the mean time the <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> having ſixe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe with him for the Right wing, diſpoſed them according as the place gave leave. And the form of the whole Battail you have here inſerted.</p>
               <p>Upon the Enemies approach, the Parliaments army marcht up to the brow of the hill, having placed a Forlorn of Foot (muſquetiers) conſiſting of about 300. down the ſteep of the hill towards the enemy, ſomewhat more then Carbine ſhot from the Main battail, who were ordered to retreat to the battail, whenſoever they ſhould be hard preſſed upon by the Enemy. The Enemy this while marched up in good order, a ſwift march, with a great deal of gallantry and reſolution, according to the form here inſerted. It is hard to ſay, whether Wing of our Horſe charged firſt: But the <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> not thinking it fit to ſtand and receive the Enemies charge, advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the Right wing of the Horſe, in the ſame order wherein it was placed. Our Word that day was, <hi>God our ſtrength;</hi> Their Word was, <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> being the left hand on the right wing, charged firſt two Diviſions of <hi>Langdales</hi> Horſe, who made a very gallant reſiſtance, and firing at a very cloſe charge, they came to the ſword: wherein Col. <hi>Whaley's</hi> Diviſions routed thoſe two Diviſions of <hi>Langdales,</hi> driving them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66403:29"/> back to Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Regiment, being the Reſerve of the enemies Foot, whither indeed they fled for ſhelter, and rallied: the Reſerves to Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> were ordered to ſecond him, which they performed with a great deal of reſolution. In the mean time, the reſt of the Diviſions of the Right wing, being ſtraightned by Furzes on the right hand, advanced with great difficulty, as alſo by reaſon of the uneavenneſſe of the ground, and a Cony-warren o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which they were to march, which put them ſomewhat out of their order, in their advance. Notwithſtanding which difficulty, they came up to the engaging the reſidue of the Enemies horſe on the left wing, whom they routed, and put into great confuſion, not one body of the enemies horſe which they charged, but they routed, and forced to flie beyond all their Foot, except ſome that were for a time ſheltred by the Brigade of Foot before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Roſsiter,</hi> who with his Regiment was juſt come into the field as the Armies were ready to cloſe; was edg'd in upon the right flank of the right wing of horſe, time not permitting a more fitting and equal diſpoſal of him: whoſe timely comming (according to his Orders) gave him opportunity of ſuch gallant performance in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as deſerves an honourable mentioning.</p>
               <p>The Horſe of the enemies Left wing being thus beaten from their Foot, retreated back about a quarter of a mile beyond the place where the battail was fought. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our Main battail was not anſwerably; The right hand of the Foot, being the <hi>Generals</hi> Regiment, ſtood, not being much preſſed upon: Almoſt all the reſt of the main Battail being overpreſſed, gave ground and went off in ſome diſorder, falling behinde the Reſerves; But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels and Officers, doing the duty of very gallant Men, in endeavouring to keep their men from diſorder, and finding their attempt fruitleſs therein, fell into the Reſerves with their Colours, chooſing rather there to fight and die, then to quit the ground they ſtood on. The Reſerves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, commanded by Col. <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66403:29"/> and Lieut. col. <hi>Pride,</hi> repelled the Enemy, forcing them to a diſorderly retreat. Thus much being ſaid of the Right wing and the main battail, it comes next in order, that an account be given of the Left wing of our Horſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the approach of the Enemies Right wing of Horſe, our Left wing drawing down the brow of the hill to meet them, the Enemy comming on faſt, ſuddenly made a ſtand, as if they had not expected us in ſo ready a poſture: Ours ſeeing them ſtand, made a little ſtand alſo, partly by reaſon of ſome diſadvantage of the ground, and untill the reſt of the Diviſions of Horſe might recover their ſtations. Upon that the Enemy advanced again, whereupon our Left wing ſounded a Charge, and fell upon them: The three right hand Diviſions of our Left wing made the firſt onſet, and thoſe Diviſions of the enemy oppoſite to them, received the Charge; thetwo left hand Diviſions of the Left wing did not advance equally, but being more backward, the oppoſite Diviſions of the Enemy advanced upon them. Of the three right hand Diviſions (before mentioned) which advanced, the middlemoſt charged not home, the other two co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing to a cloſe Charge, routed the two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Diviſions of the Enemy, (And the Commiſſary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeeing one of the enemies Brigades of Foot on his right hand, preſsing ſore upon our Foot, commanded the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was with him, to charge that Body of Foot, and for their better encouragement, he himſelf with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution fell in amongſt the Muſquetiers, where his horſe being ſhot under him, and himſelf run through the thigh with a Pike, and into the face with an Halbert, was taken priſoner by the enemy, untill afterwards, when the battell turning, and the enemy in great diſtraction, he had an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py opportunity to offer his Keeper his liberty, if he would carry him off, which was performed on both parts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.) That Diviſion of the enemies which was between, which the other Diviſion of ours ſhould have charged, was carried away in the diſorder of the other two; the one of thoſe right hand Diviſions of our Left wing that did rout
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66403:30"/> the front of the enemy, charged the Reſerve too, and broke them, the other Reſerves of the enemy came on, and broke thoſe Diviſions of ours that charged them; the Diviſions of the left hand of the right wing were likewiſe overborn, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much diſadvantage, by reaſon of pits of water, and other pieces of ditches that they expected not, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them in their order to Charge.</p>
               <p>The enemy having thus worſted our left wing, purſued their advantage, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> himſelf having proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his ſucceſſe upon the left wing, almoſt to <hi>Naſeby</hi> town, in his return ſummoned the Train, offering them quarter, which being well defended with the Fire-locks, and a Rear-guard left for that purpoſe, who fired with admirable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage on the Princes horſe, refuſing to hearken to his offer, and the Prince probably perceiving by that time the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our Right wing of Horſe, he retreated in great haſte to the reſcue of the Kings Army, which he found in ſuch a general diſtreſſe, that inſtead of attempting any thing in the reſcue of them (being cloſe followed in the Rear by ſome of Commiſſary Generals, Col. <hi>Riches,</hi> Col. <hi>Fleetwoods,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Huntingtons,</hi> and Col. <hi>Butlers</hi> horſe) he made up further, untill he came to the ground where the King was rallying the broken horſe of his Left wing, and there joyned with them, and made a ſtand.</p>
               <p>To return again to our right wing, which proſecuting their ſucceſs, by this time had beaten all the enemies horſe quite behinde their foot, which when they had accompliſhed, the remaining buſineſs was with part to keep the enemies horſe from coming to the reſcue of their foot, which were now all at mercy, except one <hi>Tertia,</hi> which with the other part of the horſe we endeavoured to break, but could not, they ſtanding with incredible courage &amp; reſolution, although we attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the Flanks, Front and Rear, untill ſuch time as the General called up his own Regiment of foot (the Lieut.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66403:30"/> broke them. The enemy had now nothing left in the Field, but his horſe, (with whom was the King himſelf) which they had put again into as good order as the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their time, and our near preſsing upon them would permit.</p>

All this did God mercifully prevent by the ſucceſſe of that battail, and turned over this condition to the enemy, and thereby laid the happy foundation of all the bleſſed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs we have had ſince.</p>
               <p>He that ſhall not in this victory look beyond the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will injuriouſly withhold from God his due: he that doth not behold God in the inſtruments, will not know how to give him his due; for when he doth actions by inſtruments, his glory is to be ſeen in inſtruments: now had I only to deale with actions, I might poſsibly by a competent expreſsion give on account of them; but who may undertake to repreſent the lively frame of an heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul, and the working of the affections in ſuch Heroick actions. The General, a man ſubject to the like infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of body, as well as paſsions of mind with other men, eſpecially to ſome infirmities (contracted by former wounds) which however at other times they may hinder that puiſſant and illuſtrious ſoul that dwels within, from giving a character of its ſelfe in his countenance; yet when he hath come upon action, or been near an engagement, it hath been obſerved, another ſpirit hath come upon him, another ſoul hath lookt out at his eyes; I mean he hath been ſo raiſed, elevated, and tranſported, as that he hath been not only unlike himſelfe at other times, but indeed more like an Angell, then a man. And this was obſerved of him at this time: now with what triumphs of faith, with what exultation of ſpirit, and with what a joynt ſhout of all the affections God is received into that heart, whoſe eyes he uſes as an Optick to look through, and trouble a proud enemy, it ſelfe only is privy to? what high tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, what deep and endearing ingagements paſſe mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally between God and ſuch a ſoul? (for certainly the moſt immediate worſhip gives not a greater advantage) is better felt experimentally, then deſcribed hiſtorically; but ſuch a diſcovery of theſe things was made in his outward man
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66403:32"/> at this Battel as highly animated his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwel</hi> uſeth theſe expreſsions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Him, in his Letter to the Houſe of Commons:</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall inlarge no further in this particular, but conclude, it was none of the leaſt pledges, none of the loweſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providences betokening good ſucceſſe to this Army, and promiſing much happineſſe to this Nation; <hi>GOD's</hi> giving us ſuch a <hi>General,</hi> and ſo giving out himſelf to our <hi>General.</hi>

               <p>The great ſhare Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi> had in this action, who commanded the Right wing of Horſe, (which did ſuch ſervice, carrying the field before them, as they did at <hi>Marston-moor</hi>) is ſo known and acknowledged, that envy it ſelf can neither detract, nor deny. One paſſage relating to his ſervice in this Battel, which I have received from thoſe that well knew it, I ſhall commend to this Hiſtorie: That he being come not above two dayes before out of the Aſſociation, and (that day the battel was) attending the General in the field, who was going to draw up for an ingagement; He had the charge and ordering of all the Horſe caſt upon him by the General unexpectedly, but a little before the Battel; which he had no ſooner received, but it was high time to apply himſelf to the diſcharge of it: for before the Field-Officers could give a tolerable account of the drawing up of the Army, the Enemy came on amain in paſsing good order, while our Army was yet in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or the order of it but an Embrio: which the Lieut. General perceiving, was ſo far from being diſmayed at it, that it was the riſe and occaſion of a moſt triumphant faith, and joy in him, expecting that GOD would do great things, by ſmall means; and by the things that are not, bring to nought things that are. A happy time, when the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66403:33"/> Lord of hoſts ſhall make his Tabernacle in the hearts and countenances of our chief Commanders; from thence to laugh his enemies to deſtruction, and have them in deriſion to confuſion!</p>

That <hi>I</hi> mention not all thoſe Officers and Souldiers particularly, who behaved themſelves ſo gallantly in this Action, is to avoyd emulation and partiality: <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf, to adde concerning them, and the whole buſineſſe, the words of the <hi>General,</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-General,</hi> in their ſeveral Letters to the Speaker of the houſe of Commons, with which <hi>I</hi> ſhall conclude. <note n="*" place="margin">Lieut.

               <p>Among other Writings taken in the Battel, there was a Manuſcript preſented to the General, (written by one Sir <hi>Edward Walker</hi> Herald of Arms) of the <hi>Kings</hi> great Victories in this War; wherein there was one paſſage very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: That whereas he, taking occaſion to ſpeak of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> cals them Rebels; the King having peruſed the Book, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the alterations he had made therein in divers places with his own hand, in that place puts out <hi>Rebels,</hi> and writes over the head, <hi>Iriſh,</hi> with his own hand, (ſo much care was there to correct and qualifie any Expreſsion that might reflect on thoſe blood-thirſty Rebels.) There was alſo brought to the head-quarter, at wooden Image, in the ſhape of a man, and in ſuch a form, as they blaſphemouſly called it the God of the Roundheads; and this they carried in ſcorn and contempt of our Army, in a publike manner, a little before the Battel begun.</p>

About ſeven a clock all their guards were drawn off, the ſouldiers on the Line threw downe their Armes, quit their Poſts, and the gates were opened, which gave invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to divers of our ſtragling ſouldiers to get into the Town at the Ports, and over the works: Complaint here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being made to his Excellency, by ſome from the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (or <hi>Loughborow</hi>) of the violation of the Articles by our ſouldiers: His Excellency ſent to the Lord <hi>Loughborow</hi> to keep all his men upon their guards, and if any offered violently to enter the Towne before the time, to fire upon them, and immediately iſſued out a Proclamation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the punctuall obſervance of the Articles by his owne ſouldiers, under paine of death. But the Lord <hi>Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> inſtead of ſtanding upon his guard (according to the Articles, till ten of the clock that morning, which he ought to have done, whereby he might have prevented that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency which fell out, and have performed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in delivering the Towne to his Excellency with the Arms and Ammunition:) mounted on horſe-back in the morning with divers Gentlemen (officers and others) and left the towne ſome houres before the time appointed for his marching forth; ſo that when our Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came according to appointment to ſee the Articles punctually performed, they found the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> was gone, and all the towne in a confuſion; but the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were commanded off, and things were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled in good order, and about eleven a clock that day, the Army entred the towne, where we found di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

               <p>There were taken in the towne, fourteen peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thirty Colours, two thouſand Armes, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, fifty barrels of Powder, and other Ammunition, in a good proportion: The poor Inhabitants were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at their deliverance, though in a ſad Condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo plundered by the Enemy at firſt taking the towne, that many had nothing left but the bare walls, who before had their ſhops and houſes well furniſhed: the Mayors houſe only eſcaped at that time, which now ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it: There is one peice of eminent wickedneſſe, fit to be tranſmitted to the notice of the world, not only for its relation to this ſtory, but to rectifie their conſciences, who have been led with too good an opinion of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and it is atteſted by perſons of good credit and quality; It is concerning Colonell <hi>Thomas</hi> a <hi>Welch-man,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who was ſlaine at the battail of <hi>Naſeby:</hi> There were two brothers of them; the other was a Lieutenant Colonell taken priſoner in the battail, the former was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the man, by the diſcription of ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> who have under their hands given this information. That the next day after the King had taken <hi>Leiceſter</hi> by ſtorme, this Colonell <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> came to the Gaole, where the priſoners they had taken at the entring the Town were put, and called for the priſoners, and commanded ſuch as were willing to ſerve the King, to come to one ſide of the room, divers of them comming accordingly, he commands them one by one to kneel down, and ſwear by <hi>Ieſus</hi> Ile ſerve the King, which ſome of them accordingly did: He not ſatisfied therewith, required them to ſwear <hi>God-dammee</hi> Ile ſerve the King, affirming publiquely, he was not fit to ſerve the King, that refuſed that Oath, which they refuſing, he drew
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66403:37"/> his Sword, cut them in the Head, in the Head, in the Arms, and other parts of the Body, wounding them in a moſt cruell man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſome of the Town of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (amongſt others) were the perſons on whom this cruelty was exerciſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill to this day maimed by theſe wounds.</p>

But upon examination of divers witneſſes, his Excellency ſaw cauſe to charge the breach of Articles on the Lord <hi>Loughborough,</hi> and the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he complained of to his own failour, and therefore to demand reparation of Him; and the carriage on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies part appearing ſo foule in many particulars, which were here too tedious to mention, the <hi>General</hi> thought fit to detain the Hoſtages; offering notwithſtanding an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the buſineſſe by Commiſsioners, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himſelf to make good whatſoever could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him in Juſtice and Honour, as he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like from them. But they, loath to truſt to the iſſue, anſwered not the meeting of our Commiſsioners; his Excellency therefore for a time detained the Hoſtages, till afterwards, upon noble conſiderations, the indempnity of his own, and the Armies honour being ſufficiently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he was pleaſed to releaſe them.</p>

That night Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> the cheif leader of the Clubmen, with ſome others of their leaders, deſired a Let-paſſe from the Generall, to preſent a Petition to the King and Parliament; the Petition being read, and found to be of a ſtrange nature, the matter was debated, their deſigne appear'd to be deſperately evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament: <hi>Hollis</hi> peremptory in his opinion, not to be convinc'd, affirming himſelfe to be one of their leaders, and that it was fit the people ſhould ſhew their ſtrength: they were promiſed they ſhould have an anſwer in writing the next morning; They were ſo ſtrong, and withall ſo confident of their ſtrength at that time, that it was held a point of prudence to be faire in demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them for a while, for if in caſe we ſhould engage with <hi>Goring,</hi> and ſome of our men be put to the Rout, theſe

               <p>If this would not ſatisfie theſe men, their own Clubs would in time have beaten reaſon into them: But to leave them, and proceed with my Story.</p>
               <p>The Army marched that day from <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> to <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the Train and moſt of the Foot quartered on the top of an hill, ſome few in <hi>Beauminſter</hi> town, a place of the pittifulleſt ſpectacle that man can behold, hardly an houſe left not conſumed with fire; the town being fired by ſome of the enemy in five places at once, when Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> was there, by reaſon of a falling out between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Corniſh.</hi> Intelligence was poſitive that night, that <hi>Goring</hi> had quite drawn off the ſiege from <hi>Taunton,</hi> and was come to <hi>Ilmiſter,</hi> and as that night his quarter would be <hi>Summerton:</hi> Whereupon his Excellency ſent a party of horſe to <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> who took ſome of his ſouldiers priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and brought them away to the Generall at <hi>Beaumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who confeſſed no leſſe then what we had heard, that the ſiege was raiſed, and that <hi>Goring</hi> was marched towards <hi>Langport.</hi> Thus is <hi>Taunton</hi> the ſecond time relieved, and our party there delivered from an eminent danger, which they feared, if we had not come thus ſeaſonably to them (being greatly diſtreſsed both for Ammunition and Victuals.) In maintaining the place this ſiege, we loſt Colonel <hi>Floyd,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Richbell,</hi> both of them faithfull experienced ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66403:41"/> and ſome officers more: In exchange of whom the Enemy loſt many Officers, and perſons of quality; one of them of more note, <hi>viz. Sir Iohn Digby,</hi> brother to <hi>Sir Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelm Digby,</hi> received there his Mortall wound, of which he afterwards dyed.</p>
               <p>But the Enemy flying, what was the Army to do but follow? And ſo they did on the morrow, a very hot reaſon, the foot weary with their long and tedious march; the carriage-horſes tyred out, the way ill and narrow; (being all incloſure) they marched that day but to <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> ſome ſix miles; but here Intelligence came that made them pull up their ſtumps, (as weary as they were) after that the Army was come into <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> they heard that our horſe ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Colonel <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> had fallen on their Reare, taken ſome Priſoners, and the great bodies were like to engage; whereupon three Regiments more were commanded to march up and aſsiſt them, if there ſhould be cauſe; two Regiments of foot alſo being ordered for that ſervice, notwithſtanding their weary march, leapt for joy; that they were like to be engaged, and according to orders marched from <hi>Crookhorne</hi> (after they had reſted an houre) to <hi>Pederton</hi> that night; the Enemy having pulled down <hi>Pederton</hi> Bridge, and made breaſt-works on the other ſide, upon our firſt approach with the partie under Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> deſerted the paſs: We inſtantly made up the Bridge, and marched over it till we came nere <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> and another party to <hi>Load-bridge</hi> where the Enemy kept the paſs with a ſtrong guard: the Generall and Leiutenant-Generall mounted inſtantly, and rode from <hi>Crookhorne</hi> after the forces, to order them, if an engagement; but the enemy ſtanding upon the advantage of the paſs, avoided it; the Generall having appointed ſtrong guards at <hi>Pederton,</hi> and <hi>Martock,</hi> returned back to <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> where ſome of the Commanders of <hi>Taunton</hi> met the Generall, and mutuall congratulations paſsed betwixt them and the Army by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this timely relief of <hi>Taunton</hi> the ſecond time: The valour, diligence, and fidelity of Colonel <hi>Welden,</hi> with the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66403:42"/> reſt of thoſe Commanders engaged with him in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that beſieged place, deſerves to be expreſſed at large; but for want of a relation of their proceedings du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſiege, I muſt content my ſelf only to mention their ſervice with honour: As alſo the good ſervice of the Horſe commanded by Colonel <hi>Graves,</hi> who in ſeverall Sallies upon the enemy were very ſucceſsfull.</p>
               <p>Lords day, <hi>Iuly</hi> 6. the Army reſting at <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> and the reſt of their quarters; about four in the afternoon, (ſix in the evening, twelve at night, and two in the morning) the Generall had certain intelligence by his Spies, confirmed by ſeverall hands, that the enemy continued ſtill at Long-<hi>Sutton,</hi> keeping a guard at Load-bridge, and making good the garriſon at <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> and <hi>Langport,</hi> the two paſſes upon the River, and had broken down the Bridge towards the town of <hi>Evill,</hi> higher up the River; whereupon orders were given for Drums to beat by four in the morning. And accordingly, <hi>Munday Iuly</hi> 7. the Foot were drawn out by ſix of the clock to a Rendezvouz, in a field about a mile from <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> in the way to <hi>Pederton.</hi> The Generall, and Lieutenant Generall went with a Party, and viewed the Paſs at Load-bridge: Our horſe appearing in great numbers, gave the enemy an Alarm, whereupon they drew up their Foot, and marcht ſome Regiments from Load-bridge, along the River ſide to <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> fearing we ſhould ſtorm that place, our horſe and theirs skirmiſhing upon the Meadows near the River by parties all that day. A Councell of war was called in the Field, to conſider what courſe to take to engage the enemy, who keeping himſelf beyond the River, and having the Garriſons of <hi>Ilcheſter, Langport, Burrough,</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> there was no poſsible comming over upon that ſide; to force our paſsage in that place where the enemy ſtood in good order on the other ſide the River to receive us, was a buſineſs of exceeding difficulty, it being alſo a Mooriſh ground. Upon the right hand the enemy had broken down the Bridge at <hi>Evill,</hi> keeping a guard of horſe upon it, and all the Bridges upon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66403:42"/> that ſide, ſo that there ſeemed to be no paſsage convenient for us, till we came to the head of the river about <hi>Sherborn,</hi> which would prove a difficult, and long march; upon which it was reſolved to march the greateſt part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Evill,</hi> and there to force our paſsage, leaving ſtill a convenient number both of horſe and foot, over againſt <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> and <hi>Load-Bridge,</hi> to engage the enemy, in caſe he ſhould atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to advance on this ſide; accordingly our foot marched to <hi>Evill,</hi> the head-quarter for that night; we were no ſooner come there, but the enemies horſe retreated to <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter;</hi> Orders were given to make up the bridge, which was ſpeedily done: <hi>Iuly the</hi> 8. early in the morning certaine Intelligence was brought to the Army, by one of their ſpies (ſent for that purpoſe into the Enemies Army) that the enemy (hearing the paſs at <hi>Evill</hi> was gained by our forces,) retreated towards <hi>Langport</hi> with the Army, quit <hi>Load-Bridge,</hi> burnt divers faire houſes there. Colonel <hi>Phillips</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> in the night time, quit the towne, leaving the works ſtanding undemoliſhed, only the <hi>Bridewell,</hi> a place the enemy had fortified, they ſet on fire, which was quickly quenched by the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>This day the Army declining to march over the paſſe at <hi>Evill,</hi> hearing <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> was quit, marched back towards <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> upon the ſame ſide the river, and quartered there that night, where no proviſions were left for our ſouldiers. Intelligence alſo came, that whilſt we went on the other ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This day Colonel <hi>Butlers</hi> Regiment commanded by Major <hi>Fincher,</hi> quarter-maſter-Gen. of our horſe, came up
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66403:43"/> to the Army, &amp; in their march from <hi>Barkly</hi> Caſtle, did very good ſervice; firſt at <hi>Durſly,</hi> they entertained Sir <hi>Charles Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> comming to beat up their quarters, kil'd the Captain of the forlorne hope, after that charged the party with two troops, kil'd ten (whereof two Captains) took 39 priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, hurt Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> himſelfe; from thence they came to <hi>Hyworth,</hi> where the enemy from <hi>Farringdon</hi> had entred the towne, whom they beat out, and delivered to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour the quiet poſſeſsion of his garriſon; from thence to the <hi>Devizes,</hi> where they took ſome horſe, and ſo to <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> where they took ſome of <hi>Sherborn</hi> horſe, and ſo came to the Army very ſeaſonably, the Army being neerer an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement then they expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday Iuly</hi> 9. The Army marched to <hi>Long-Sutton,</hi> news came there that Major-Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> was neer upon an engagement; the Generall immediatly gave command that Colonel <hi>Montague</hi> ſhould march with 2000 muſquetiers to his aſsiſtance, (being in an incloſed country) who marched accordingly, but the engagement was over before he could come up, and the welcome newes was brought that <hi>Gorings</hi> party which the Major-Gen. had there engaged, was beaten, many ſlaine, nine Colours and 300 horſe taken, Colonel <hi>Cook</hi> a Gentleman of much temper and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carryed himſelfe gallantly in that ſervice, and received a ſhot through both cheeks: this afternoon ours had continuall skirmiſhing with the enemies horſe at a paſſe, a mile on this ſide <hi>Langport,</hi> took a <hi>French</hi> Cornet and his Colours, a <hi>Dutchman</hi> and a <hi>Spaniard</hi> priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday Iuly</hi> 10. A councel of War was held, what courſe we ſhould take to force the enemy to fight, ſeeing he ſtood upon his advantage, having the paſses upon the River, and might fight or flie at pleaſure; whileſt the counſell of War were in debate thereof, not knowing what to do (the enemy being ſtill at his election, whether to fight or not) Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence came that the enemy was advanced with his foot from <hi>Langport</hi> to the paſs, and had lined the hedges thick with muſquetiers, and drawne up his Ordnance; this reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66403:43"/> ved the queſtion at the councell of War, without puting it; whereupon the Generall and Lieutenant-Generall <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and all the Officers inſtantly mounted, rode up to the field, perceived the enemy to put himſelfe in a poſture for an engagement; inſtantly the Army was ordered to be put in Battalia, the forlorne hope of horſe and foot drew out, Ordnance were drawn downe to places of advantage, meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were ſent to recall moſt of the horſe and foot, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to aſsiſt Major-Gen. <hi>Maſsey,</hi> but before they could come up, our Ordnance began to play (a good while before the foot engaged) doing great execution upon the body of the enemies Army, both horſe and foot, who ſtood in good order upon the hill, (about muſquet ſhot from the paſſe) and forcing them to draw off their Ordnance, and their horſe to remove their ground; Our foot advanced down the hill to the paſs, and with admirable reſolution charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy from hedge to hedge, till they got the paſs; the enemies horſe upon this drew downe towards us, whereupon our horſe advanced over the paſſe up the hill to the enemy; the Forlorne-hope of horſe commanded by Major <hi>Bethell,</hi> gave a valiant and brave charge indeed, broke that body that charged him, and the next reſerve: our reſerve of horſe that was commanded by Major <hi>Desborough,</hi> very reſolutely charged the next ſtanding bodies of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo home, that inſtantly they put them to a diſorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, &amp; our muſquetiers came cloſe up to our horſe, firing upon the enemy, whereupon their Regiments of white Colours; and black Colours of foot, before ever they engaged, marched away apace; the Forlorne under Major <hi>Bethell,</hi> and thoſe under Major <hi>Desborough,</hi> were going in purſuit of the chaſe, but receiving orders to ſtay till more bodies of horſe were come up, that the purſuit might be orderly, and with good reſerves, in caſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould face about, and charge againe, (which was not impoſsible) they obeyed their orders, as good ſouldiers will, though it check their ſweeteſt pleaſure (as to purſue a flying enemy was no leſs:) when the enemy had fled about two
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66403:44"/> miles they made a ſtand in a plaine green field, (where the paſsage out was narrow) called <hi>Aller Drove,</hi> but received only a piece of a charge, and then ſeeing our bodies come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on orderly and faſt, faced about, and never ſtood after: the paſses being narrow in many places, and the ditches being deep and wide, eſpecially at that place where they firſt faced about, many horſes of the Enemies were loſt in the ditches, whereof our ſouldiers recovered ſtore, and the riders got into the meadows, hoping to eſcape, but could not. We purſued the Enemy within two miles of <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> (whither the enemy fled,) doing execution upon them all the way (being eight miles in length) took about 1400 priſoners, about 1200 horſe, and divers Officers of quality, Colonel <hi>Henningham,</hi> Colonel <hi>Slingsby</hi> (the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Gorings</hi> Ordnance) were alſo taken; about thirty Colours of Horſe and Foot: and on the other hand, it was a victory as cheap to us, as dear to them; we loſt no Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, not twenty common ſouldiers; ſome fourteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of Major <hi>Bethels</hi> troop were hurt, and himſelf ſhot in the right hand. No ſooner was the Enemy put to a retreat, but in great confuſion they quitted <hi>Langport,</hi> into which many of them had fled (a ſtrong garriſon, naturally well fortified, being about half a mile from the place of the fight) and ſet it on fire, but by the induſtry of the ſouldiers and Towneſmen it was quenched. The Enemy with a body of Foot drawing along with them two pieces of Ordnance by the way of <hi>Langport,</hi> were purſued by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the Ordnance and moſt of the Foot taken. And thus you have in a very ſhort ſpace an account of a very great action.</p>

               <p>Monday, <hi>Iuly</hi> 14. a Councel of war was called, great debate whether to ſtorm the town, or not: Some incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, but no poſitive reſolution; Notwithſtanding preparations were made in order to a ſtorm, the Souldiers cheerfully made their faggots, and were drawn in readines for a ſtorm, but upon further conſideration were for that time drwn back to their quarters; and more time being taken, there were 8 long Bridges, betwixt 30 and 40 foot length, deviſed to be made by Lieutenant-general <hi>Hamond,</hi> the Lieutenant-general of the Ordnance (a Gentleman of approved fidelity, and of a moſt dexterous and ripe inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all ſuch things) which were approved of by the Commanders and Officers, and accordingly Ordered to be made, and were of very great uſe to the Souldier in the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>This day, the General going over the river to view the poſts on the other ſide, was graciouſly delivered from a great danger he was near unto by a ſudden ſurpriſal of the Tide called the <hi>Eager,</hi> where he very narrowly eſcaped drowning.</p>
               <p>Tueſday, <hi>Iuly</hi> 15. the General went to <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned that night to the head quarter.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday <hi>Iuly</hi> 16. a Counſel of war was again called, and ſeveral propoſitions were made for the framing of our Army, and reduction of the town, both being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66403:45"/> and vehemently deſired by us. To riſe with our whole Army and leave the town unattempted, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be very prejudiciall to our future progreſſe; To ſit down before it (being a place of that ſtrength, and we not ſure to carry it) leaving the Enemy at liberty to rally his broken forces, ſeemed very hazardous.</p>
               <p>The blocking of it up by Forts on both ſides with a part of our Army was propounded; but the difficulty of laying a Bridge over the River through the violence of the current, (which yet was neceſſary for the maintaining a communication between our quarters on both ſides) hindred that deſigne.</p>
               <p>It was propounded to attempt it by approaches; But it was conſidered, that if we ſhould have gone that way, it would have proved very tedious; and if during our ſtay about it any great glut of rain ſhould have fallen, it would have laid us wet in our trenches, and diſabled us from ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>At laſt, a reſolution to ſtorm it was agreed upon, though it carried the greateſt danger with it: yet the deſire which the Army had to be ſpeedily free for the further ſervice of the Kingdom, ſurmounted all difficulties: the ſtorming being thus happily reſolved on, to the great and generall ſatisfaction of all that Army, both Officers and Souldiers; Lots were drawn for every one to take their poſts, ſome to ſtorm, ſome to be reſerves, others to alarm, but the time of falling on not yet determined.</p>
               <p>Friday <hi>Iuly</hi> 19. it was reſolved at a Counſel of War, that the time of the ſtorm ſhould be on Monday morning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dawning of the day. The Brigade appointed to ſtorm on that ſide towards <hi>Devon</hi> was commanded by Major General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> being the Regiments of Col. <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> Col. <hi>Inglesby,</hi> Col. <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> Col. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Col. <hi>Birch,</hi> and Major General <hi>Maſsies</hi> own Regiment: the Regiments deſigned on this ſide, were the Generals, Major-generals, Col. <hi>Pickerings,</hi> Col. <hi>Montagues,</hi> Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Wallers,</hi> the Regiment commanded by Lieut. Colonel <hi>Pride,</hi> Colonel
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66403:46"/> 
                  <hi>Rainsboroughs,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Hamonds.</hi> The General rode round about the town this day, to ſee if all things were in readines for the ſtorm, that both ſides might fall on toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. On the Lords day, <hi>Iuly</hi> 20. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> in the forenoon preached a Preparation Sermon, to encourage the Souldiers to go on: Mr. <hi>Bowles</hi> likewiſe did his part in the afternoon. After both Sermons, the Drums beat, the Army was drawn out into the field: The Commanders of the forlorn hope who were to begin the ſtorm, and the Souldiers, being drawn together in the field, were there alſo afreſh exhorted to do their duties (with undaunted courage and reſolution) by Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> who did it (as one ſayes of him) <hi>tàm Marte, quàm Mercurio.</hi> As ſoon as it grew dark, the Souldiers drew every one to their ſeverall Poſts allotted them to ſtorm; the ſigne when the ſtorm was to begin, was, the ſhooting off three peeces of Ordnance on this ſide, which the Forces on the other ſide were to take notice of, and to fall on at the inſtant: and on Monday, <hi>Iuly</hi> 22. about two of the clock in the morning, the ſtorm began accordingly on this ſide of the town, (the Forces on the other ſide only alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy, which kept them upon the Line, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtorm) Our Forlorn hope was manfully led on by Lieut. colonel <hi>Hewſon;</hi> and as valiantly ſeconded by the Generals Regiment, commanded by Lieut. colonel <hi>Iackſon;</hi> and the Major-generals, commanded by Lieut. colonel <hi>Aſhfield.</hi> The Bridges prepared to paſſe over the Moat, were quickly brought to the Ditch, and thrown in, on which the Souldiers with little loſſe got over the deep ditch, and with undaunted courage mounted the Enemies works (notwithſtanding the great and ſmall ſhot which ſhowred about them) beat them from their Ordnance, turn'd them upon the enemy, &amp; let down their drawbridg; which made many of their Foot inſtantly cry, <hi>Quarter, Quarter.</hi> The Bridge being let down, Captain <hi>Rainolds,</hi> who commanded the forlorn hope of horſe, immediatly entred, and ſcoured the ſtreets of that part of the Town ſo gained, called <hi>Eaſtover,</hi> with much gallantry and reſolution, even
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66403:46"/> up to the Draw-bridge over the main Ditch, leading to the ſecond Town: whereupon the reſt of the Officers and Souldiers that were in a body, and yet annoyed us in that part of the town which we had won, threw down their arms, and had fair quarter given them: (there were about 600. taken priſoners, Officers and Souldiers) The Enemy inſtantly made barracadoes at the gate upon the bridge, and drew up the bridge that divided one part of the town from the other. Our forces had not been two houres in the firſt town, but the Enemy ſhot granadoes, and ſlugs of hot iron, and fired it on both ſides, which by the next morning burnt that part of the town (of goodly buildings) down to the ground, except three or four houſes, Major <hi>Cowel,</hi> who had a good ſhare in that ſervice, ſtanding all that while in the midſt of the ſtreet, which was both ſides on fire, keeping guards to prevent the Enemies ſallying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Captain <hi>Sampſon,</hi> in that remarkable action, received a ſhot.</p>
               <p>The General, hoping that the Storm might have wrought upon the Souldiers, &amp; the Fire upon the Townſ-men, ſo far, that they would have hearkened to a treaty; renewed his Summons, which the Governour perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refuſed, according to his allegiance (as he ſaid) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Tueſday, Iuly</hi> 22. it was reſolved to alarm the town by our forces on this ſide, and to ſtorm it by the other forces on the other ſide, at two of the clock the next morning; for which purpoſe the <hi>General</hi> was there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſee it done, though it was held fit on after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, only to alarm on both ſides, which much amazed the Enemy, and kept him waking that night: Alſo about two of the clock in the afternoon, the <hi>General</hi> ſent to the Governour a Trumpet with a meſſage to this purpoſe, that his denial of fair tearms had wrought in him no other thoughts, but of compaſsion towards thoſe that were innocent, who otherwiſe might ſuffer through the Governours obſtinacy: Wherefore he ſignified his noble pleaſure, that all women and children that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66403:47"/> would accept of this liberty, ſhould come forth of the town by four of the clock in the afternoon, which being made known to them, the Governours Lady and divers others came out. They were no ſooner come forth, but our Cannon plaid fiercely into the town, Granadoes were ſhot, and ſlugs of hot iron in abundance, whereby ſeveral houſes in the town were fired, and the wind being high increaſt the flame, the townſmen within were in great diſtraction, every man imployed how to ſave his houſe and goods, the Enemy in a great amazement, and the Governour ſo far melted, as to ſend forth <hi>Tom Elliot</hi> in haſte, to deſire to know the <hi>Generals</hi> tearms; the <hi>General</hi> refuſed to admit of any treaty at all, reſolved that the Governour and they within that had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo fine a town, ſhould have no conditions, but ſhould ſubmit to mercy; which being ſignified to the Enemy, they yet would try the <hi>General</hi> with theſe three particulars.

               <p>The Governour returned anſwer, that he found thoſe Propoſitions ſo ill reſented, both by the Gentlemen and Souldiers, that he could not accept of them. The <hi>General</hi> thereupon gave order to the ſouldiers to ſtand upon their guard, and go to their duties; <hi>Tom Elliot</hi> deſired nothing might be done till he returned, leaving Sir <hi>Iohn Heale</hi> as caution, which was agreed to; and he preſently returned with an anſwer of ſubmiſsion to the <hi>Generals</hi> Articles, only ſlipt in a motion for himſelf, that he might have liberty to carry the news to the King upon his Parol. May he have more ſuch imployment till peace be ſetled!</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Hoſtages were ſent, Sir <hi>Iohn Heale,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Windham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waldron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Warr,</hi> Mr. <hi>Siddingham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Speake.</hi> And we ſent ſome into the Town to them.</p>
               <p>They were to deliver the Town and yield themſelves priſoners the next morning by eight of the clock, and all that night they imployed themſelves to quench the fire in the town. The loſſe of men in this ſtorm was not many, Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> an Officer in the train had his leg ſhot, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cut off, whereof he died, he behaved himſelf va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. the town was ſurrendred, about 1000 Officers and Souldiers, beſides Gentlemen and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Clergy, marched out as priſoners. There were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the town about 44 barrels of powder, 1500 armes, 44 piece of ordnance, 400 weight of match, Enemies goods of great value, that had been carried for ſecurity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place, and were ſeized by the Commiſsioners of the Parliament, and ſould; and 5. s. a man raiſed upon the ſale, to be beſtowed as a reward upon the common ſouldiers for their good ſervice in the ſtorming of the place.</p>
               <p>That which may ſeem to allay the happineſs of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was, that the town was fired; but truly though in ſtrictneſs of ſouldiery this might be very well juſtified, yet God in his providence concurred to the juſtice of it, and our acquittance: They refuſed treaty after part taken, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66403:48"/> fired the part we had taken, and rang the bels for joy when they ſaw it blaze: and as we are credibly informed, they fired the town themſelves in many places where fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works could do no hurt, the ſouldiers ſaying, <hi>The Town did it to be rid of them;</hi> the town ſaid, the ſouldiers did it, when they were in little hopes to hold it. But God be thanked, we found much more of it ſtanding then we expected. Some things there are which made the buſineſſe conſiderable. As firſt, that by it a line of garriſons was drawn over that <hi>Ihſtmus</hi> of ground between the South-ſea and <hi>Severne,</hi> by <hi>Bridgewater, Taunton, Lime,</hi> and <hi>Langport,</hi> it being from <hi>Bridgewater</hi> to <hi>Lime</hi> little above twenty miles, by which the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal</hi> then wholly in the Enemies poſſeſsion, except <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> were in a manner blockt up from all entercourſe with the Eaſtern parts, a buſineſs of no ſmall conſequence, if we had proceeded no further. Likewiſe this being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, our Army was at liberty for further work, which was a great mercy at that time of the year. It was a great gain with little loſſe: and that which addes as much to the commendation of the action, as any thing, we kept our Articles exactly, which is not only honourable in the eyes of men, but acceptable in the ſight of God, and that which this war hath ſcarce formerly attained; and it was not done without ſome difficulty now, in regard our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had ſuffered ſo much, and <hi>Cornwal</hi> was ſo near.</p>
               <p>Thurſday <hi>Iuly</hi> 24. All the day was ſpent in ordering the manner of ſending away the priſoners, and ſecuring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants goods in the town. And thus you have that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant fight at <hi>Langport</hi> crowned with an eaſie recovery of that conſiderable ſtrength of <hi>Brigdewater,</hi> whoſe natural fortification by water, they that knew, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, God was the Bridge by which our Army got over.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FRiday, <hi>Iuly</hi> 25. A Councell of war was called, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe how, and which way next, the Army might lay out themſelves to the moſt advantage and beſt ſervice of the Common-wealth; whether to make up further Weſt to <hi>Goring,</hi> or to ſtay in the Eaſtern parts to curb the <hi>Club-men.</hi> And in favour of this latter, it was conſidered, that the Army wanted Ammunition, to march far Weſt, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any conſiderable action: and that this was a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work, there being alſo ſeverall Garriſons of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by which the Club-men took great boldneſſe to ſhew themſelves. It was therefore inclined unto by the Councell of war, that the Army ſhould firſt make it their buſineſſe to reduce the Club-men to better manners, and to that end, to attempt the taking in, at leaſt, to keep in that Garriſon, which countenanced and encouraged them, <hi>viz. Sherborn</hi> Caſtle, where Sir <hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> an active Enemy, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Souldier, was Commander in chief: But the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Councell of war was, notwithſtanding, to advance rather more Weſt, to proſecute our victory at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> and hinder <hi>Goring</hi> for rallying his ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered force, or raiſing any conſiderable body, leaving ſome force to attend P. <hi>Ruperts</hi> motion about <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Clubmen if they frequented meetings as formerly. A march being thus reſolved on; it was accordingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken on the morrow, whence the Army marched to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock,</hi> ten miles, in order to a more Weſterly march: where reſting the Lords day, there was a thankſgiving for the ſucceſſe in the taking of <hi>Bridgewater.</hi> The Generall, who ever accounted it his greateſt ſafety, to act according to the adviſe of his Councel of war (whom God had ſo often bleſſed in their reſolutions) was at this time much troubled in his thoughts, concerning his march further Weſt, before <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Sherborn</hi> were abſolutely reduced, and the diſ-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Club-men brought to more obedience: Reckoning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66403:49"/> it alſo a ſervice of importance to take in <hi>Bath,</hi> in order to the ſtraitening of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and hindring P. <hi>Rupert</hi> for raiſing any conſiderable force in thoſe parts: Whereupon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency took a reſolution to march back, and accordingly came to <hi>Wells</hi> that night with part of the Army and Train, being 14. long miles, and a hot day, and ſent a Brigade of horſe and foot unto <hi>Sherborn</hi> under the command of that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſerving Commander, Col. <hi>Pickering,</hi> to face that garriſon, and to view the ſame; and if there were hopes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, to ſit down before it, in order to a ſiege. The Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters this night were neerer unto <hi>Bath,</hi> &amp; more force was ſent to get between <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Briſtol;</hi> having intelligence that their diſtractions were ſuch in <hi>Bath,</hi> that they would eaſily be driven to quit it: But the General ſtayed at <hi>Wells,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear from the party of Horſe and Dragoons under the command of Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> which he had ſent towards <hi>Bath.</hi>

Towards evening, our Dragoons, commanded by Colonel <hi>Okey,</hi> were drawn neer the bridge, and crept on their bellies over it, to the Gate, ſeized on the ſmall end of the enemies Muſquets, which they put through the loop-holes of the Gate, and cryed to the enemy to take quarter, which ſo affrighted the enemy, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We found in the town ſix pieces of Ordnance, 400. Arms, 12. barrels of Powder, the Works, beſides the Wall of the City, ſtrong and tenable. It was yielded in a good time, for Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was advanced with a Party of 1500 horſe and foot from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> within four miles, to

               <p>Lords day <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3. News came this day that all the Country of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Dorcet,</hi> and part of <hi>Summerſet,</hi> were up in Armes, and would have a Rendezvouz of 10000. men at leaſt, pretending they did it to fetch off their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; (but privately we underſtood it was to interrupt our ſiege, and to hinder proviſions from comming to the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer; giving out withall, that <hi>Goring</hi> with his Army was comming out of the <hi>Weſt</hi> to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Munday Auguſt</hi> 4. Lieutenant-Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> having Intelligence of ſome of their places of Rendezvouz for their ſeverall diviſions, went forth with a party of horſe to meet with them; (being well ſatisfied of the danger of their deſigne.) As he was marching towards <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> with the party, they diſcovered ſome colours upon the top of a high hill, full of wood, and almoſt inacceſsible; a Lieutenant with a ſmall party was ſent to them to know their meaning, and to acquaint them that the Lieutenant-Generall of the Army was there; whereupon Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> one of their leaders, thought fit to come downe, and told us the intent was to deſire to know why the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were taken at <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> on Saturday; the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Gen. returned him this anſwer; that he held himſelfe not bound to give him, or them an account; what was done was by authority, and they that did it were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponſible to them that had none: but not to leave them wholly unſatisfied, he told him that thoſe perſons ſo met, had been the occaſions and ſtirrers of many tumultuous and unlawfull meetings, for which they were to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law, which triall ought not by them to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or interrupted: Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> deſired to goe up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the anſwer; the Lieutenant-Generall with a ſmall party went with him, and had ſome conference with the people, to this purpoſe: that whereas they pretended to meet there to ſave their goods, they took a very ill courſe for that: to leave their houſes was the way to looſe their goods; and it was offered them, that Juſtice ſhould be done upon any who offered them violence; and as for

               <p>Theſe being thus quietly ſent home, the Lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall advanced further, to a meeting of a greater number, of about 4000. who betook themſelves to <hi>Hambleton</hi> Hill, near <hi>Shrawton;</hi> at the bottome of the hill we met a man with a Muſquet, and asked whither he was going, he ſaid, to the Club-Army; we asked what he meant to do, he asked what we had to do with that: Being required to lay down his Arms, he ſaid he would firſt loſe his life, but was not ſo good as his word, for though he cockt, and preſented his Muſquet, he was prevented, diſarmed, and wounded, but not killed. Then we marched up the hill, which had been an old Romane-work, deeply trenched: The Lieutenant-generall ſent before a Lieutenant with a party of horſe, to require an account of their meeting; he was anſwered with half a dozen ſhot, and could get no other anſwer; thereupon one Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> who upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach came from them, was ſent in, requiring them to ſubmit to the power and protection of the Parliament, and lay down their Arms; they refuſed to leave their Arms, and gave us a ſhot as we were drawing up, the Lieutenant Generall unwilling to bloodſhed, ſent Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> again, to tell them, that if they would not lay down their Arms, he would fall upon them; they refuſed this third meſſage alſo, through the inſtigation of Mr. <hi>Branell,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Compton,</hi> who told them they muſt ſtand to it now, rather then loſe their Arms, and that he would Piſtoll them that gave back.</p>
               <p>Thereupon Order was given to the Generals Troop to fall on, who did ſo, and received a repulſe, and ſome loſſe through the diſadvantage of the place, for the Club-men ſhot from the bank of the old Work, and kept the paſſage with Muſquets, and other weapons, which was no broader
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66403:51"/> then for three horſe to march a breſt; upon this attempt we loſt a man or two, had eight or nine wounded, ſix or ſeven horſes killed: upon this, Major <hi>Desborough</hi> with the Generals Regiment, went round about a ledge of the hill, and made a hard ſhift to climbe up and enter on their rear; which they no ſooner diſcerned, but after a ſhort diſpute they ran, and the paſſage formerly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted was opened, and all the Club-men diſperſed, and diſarmed, ſome ſlaine, many wounded, the reſt ſlid and tumbled downe that great ſteep hill, to the hazard of their necks; there were brought away 400. of them to <hi>Shrawton,</hi> of which neere 200. were wounded in this ſkirmiſh, Capt. <hi>Paltiſon</hi> was ſore hurt on our ſide, of which afterwards he dyed, and about twelve more; we found among them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 16. of our men whom they had diſarmed, and taken priſoners, and threatened to hang ſome of them, but the Tables were then turned; we quartered that night at <hi>Shrawton,</hi> and kept the Club-men in the church, and with them, four Vicars and Curats which were taken with them, upon the Hill; whereof Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> of <hi>Milton</hi> was one, and <hi>Lawford</hi> of <hi>Auckford,</hi> the worſt, another. There was taken about 12 Colours, the Motto of one of them was thus: <hi>(If you offer to plunder or take our cattel, Be aſſured we will bid you battel.)</hi> In others of them they had ſentences of Scripture, profanely applied by their Malignant Prieſts, who were the principal ſtirrers up of the people to theſe tumultuous aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>The next day, <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. we took their names and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, who were their Leaders, and what the grounds of their meeting were; which they freely diſcovered, and confeſſed that Mr. <hi>Bravel</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Compton,</hi> ſent out the Warrants; and the intent was (as appeares by a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Langton</hi>) gallantly to demand their Countrymen, or to take ſo many priſoners as ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe them, as the Warrant ran. And that they had laid down their arms and ſubmitted, had it not been for <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> and <hi>Lawford;</hi> and that they ſent to <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:66403:51"/> to come and joyne with them, whoſe journey is now ſtopt. After the examination, the Lieutenant-Gen. ſpake to them, giving them liberty to defend themſelves againſt plunderings; only forbidding any ſuch meetings, which they proteſted againſt, and freely conſented, that if any of them (whoſe names were in the paper) were taken again oppoſing the Parliament, or in any ſuch aſſembly, they deſerved to be hanged, whereupon they were diſmiſsed, to their very good ſatisfaction, and confeſsed they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miſled by their leaders, who by a pretence to ſave their goods, indangered both their goods and lives, and ſo ours parted with them, hoping never to meet them again upon ſuch terms; but their leaders were extreamly partiall on the Kings ſide, notwithſtanding their pretended indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies, as appeared in <hi>Bravels</hi> activity, ſince he was at Court with their Petition, &amp; their calling men <hi>Roundheads</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to joyn with them; thratening no leſs then loſs of goods and danger of life, to them that would not come in to them. This work, though unhappy, was very neceſsarie, for that the Army could ſend neither meſsengers nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before; whereas this done, a man might ride very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly between <hi>Sherborne</hi> and <hi>Salisbury.</hi> The influence the King had upon them was very palpable and notorious, and that they acted his very deſigne; Commiſsions were found under the Princes owne hand, for raiſing Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Club-men, which commiſsions were ſent up to the Parliament; and that this deſigne was to have been ſet on foot in other parts, yea in the Aſsociated counties, and all the parts of the Kingdom, to raiſe a third party (as that that the King did much rely upon, if other aid did faile) there is but too much reaſon to beleive; and that Letters of the Club-men were found among Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, declaring their intention to ſerve the King, is no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity to affirme, and ſuch was the ſenſe of the danger the kingdome and the Parliaments cauſe was in by this third party, had it gone on as it was beginning, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it is ſufficient (I need not inlarge upon it) to provoke
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66403:52"/> thankfulneſſe to God for the ſeaſonable laying of this ſpirit, which never afterwards appear'd.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> at night <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5. The Lieutenant-Generall with the party returned to <hi>Sherborne,</hi> where they found the Generall and the reſt of the Army very buſie at the ſiege; a ſtorme was intended, but upon ſecond thoughts divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Army ſeeing recruits come ſo far below expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in time and number, it behoved them to take more then ordinary care of their men, though after all their tedious marches, and deſperate ſervices, to that time the Army was not much abated; that day a commanded party crept underneath the ſtone wall cloſe by <hi>Sherborne</hi> Caſtle, and gained the hay-ſtack within a ſtones caſt of their Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday Auguſt</hi> 6. The Enemy making a new work to plant Ordnance to beat our men from the hay-ſtack, we beat them off that work, and diſmounted their Canon, but had four Captaines wounded, and one ſlaine; all things were in a preparation to ſtorme; this day the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had every one his faggot prepared, another Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was ſent unto the Caſtle to ſurrender the ſame, but a deniall was returned, whereupon a councell of War was called, and it was reſolved, that ſince an whole Canon was upon the way from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and that from <hi>Mendeep</hi> hils we might have excellent Miners, that therefore we ſhould proceed in approaches &amp; Batteries for the reducing of the Caſtle, being well informed that the ground whereon it ſtood was mineable: This day towards evening, Capt. <hi>Horſey</hi> another of Colonel <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Officers was ſhot dead in the place with a birding peice from one of the Towers: who with Captain-Lieutenant <hi>Flemming</hi> of Col. <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Regiment, (who was ſhot before) were the next day buried after a martiall manner in the Church at <hi>Sherborne,</hi> being the place where Captaine <hi>Horſeys</hi> Anceſtors were intombed.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Friday Auguſt</hi> 8. The Generall going to ſee the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66403:52"/> working of the Mine, (as afterwards both Saturday and Lords day he did ſeverall times,) and the making of the Gallery, eſcaped another great danger by his own ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who encompaſsing ſome Dear, ſhot round, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of their fellows, and miſſed the General (as he was paſsing by) narrowly.</p>
               <p>Very freely did the ſouldiers work in the Mines and Galleries, and making of Batteries, every man being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded twelve pence a piece for the day, and as much for the night, for the ſervice was hot and hazardous.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Monday Auguſt</hi> 11. The whole Canon, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the Army formerly mentioned, and then long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Army, came to the head quarter. This day his <hi>Excellency</hi> had intelligence, that Major Generall <hi>Maſsies</hi> horſe, who were quartered near <hi>Taunton,</hi> to interrupt <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> forces in caſe they advanced this way, had fallen on ſome of <hi>Gorings</hi> horſe, and taken ſeverall priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday Auguſt</hi> 12. The <hi>Mendeep</hi> Miners came, and were ſet to work; the enemy threw fiery Faggots over thoſe parts of the Wall where the Miners were, and where a Bridge likewiſe was making (over a little Rivolet,) which was in part burnt thereby, but the ſouldiers preſently quenched it, and it was put over that night. The Generall according to his wonted nobleneſs ſent to Sir <hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> That if he pleaſed to ſend out his Lady, or any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he would give way to it; Sir <hi>Lewis</hi> thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the favour, ſeemed to incline to accept of it, but gave no poſitive anſwer, expreſsing withall his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſouldier-like) to hold out to the laſt; but under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it was a madneſſe rather then valour, ſeeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of relief, and ſince that he hath felt the miſery of it by a long impriſonment in the Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday Auguſt</hi> 13. The Canon and Demi-Canon were planted on the new Battery, where another chiefe Gunner of ours was ſlain, beſides one <hi>Ienkins,</hi> another Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was ſhot from the Tower. The Miners wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two yards of the Wall, where the Rock appearing, we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66403:53"/> feared it would have given more interruption then it did, but it proving but a ſoft ſtone, was eaſily wrought tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The Generall and Lieutenant Generall vvere twice again this day at the Works and Mines, ſo much did they ſtill engage their perſons in the care and overſight of every ſuch vvork.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday Auguſt</hi> 14. The great Guns began to play about eleven of the clock, and before ſix had made a breach in the middle of the Wall, that ten a breaſt might enter, and had beaten down one of the Towers, vvhich much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened the enemy. On this occaſion the great adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of many of the ſouldiers comes fitly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, vvho (vvhileſt our Canon played hard upon the Caſtle, and vvanted ſhot) fetcht off the Bullets (that vve had ſhot) from under the enemies Walls, and had ſix pence a piece for every Bullet they ſo brought off, vvhich vvere vvorth as much to the ſervice at that time. After the breach ſo made, ſuch vvas the noble and mercifull diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Generall, that he ſent a third Summons to ſurrender the Caſtle, or to expect extremity, vvhich drave the Governour into a great paſsion (vvhich is not hard to do) in ſo much as he ſaid, he vvould hang the Drum; and vvhen the Drum, delivering his meſsage ſtoutly, vvas as he thought, ſawcy, he told him he muſt have more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in his preſence, and ſent an anſwer to this purpoſe; That the language was ſo far differing from vvhat he had formerly received, that he could not believe that it came from the ſame hand, but ſaid, that he vvould not loſe his honour to ſave his life (it may be (as one ſayes of him) becauſe his Cauſe and carriage had already loſt it) if the laſt vvere, he ſhould think it vvell beſtowed in the ſervice. This day another of our Gunners vvas ſhot vvith a bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piece. By this time our approaches vvere ſo near, that they could have no uſe of their Muſquets, only threw down ſtones: And this day our ſouldiers upon the guard, (commanded then by Colonel <hi>Inglesby,</hi> a gallant and vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving Gentleman) happily gained the Tower in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66403:53"/> corner of the Caſtle, out of which our Muſquetiers play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Caſtle, recompenced with a fatall ſhot one of the enemies chief markſmen, that had ſo often ſhot out of the Tower with the birding piece, and killed our men: Impatient were our men to fall on, but in regard the Mine was not ready to ſpring, that night it was reſolved to put off the ſtorm till the next day, but in the mean time ſo near did our ſouldiers venture to the Walls from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, that they pulled the Wooll out of the Wooll-ſacks that lay on the enemies Works, vvhich cauſed that ſtrong guards vvere ſet by the enemy: this night great fires were made in the Caſtle all night long, to diſcover our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and mines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday Auguſt</hi> 15. Two in the morning, the Governour having cooled his brain with a little ſleep, (without any other provocation) ſent out a Drummer with a meſſage, that he was willing to ſurrender upon honourable terms; anſwer vvas returned, no terms but <hi>Quarter,</hi> ſeeing he had ſlipt and ſlighted the opportunity, and he vvas not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that, except he rendred ſpeedily. Immediatly the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall went in perſon to the Works, and viewed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle within, over the Wall, not without great hazard, gave Orders for all things to be prepared for a ſtorm, every ſouldier to cut his freſh Faggot, whereby in two houres they had above 6000 Faggots, with which they were to fill the Trenches, and to throw ſtones and rubbiſh upon them; whilſt this was in doing, our ſouldiers that had before gained one Tower, recovered alſo another of their Towers, and from thence proved as good markſmen as theirs vvere; and out of the ſame Towers vvhere they ſhot ſo many of our men, did good execution upon the enemy within: (Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> his Secretary vvas ſlain by a ſhot from thence;) and being ſo happily poſſeſt of this Tower, vve improved it further, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them from their Guns within, which they had planted to oppoſe our entrance at the breach; the Miners had by this time wrought quite through the foundation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66403:54"/> of the Wall, and our foot plaid ſo hard from the breach, that they were forced to quit the great Court within the Caſtle; this much diſheartened the enemy, and eſpecially ſeeing our ſouldiers comming forwards ſo merrily with Faggots on their backs to fall on, ſome of them before their time appointed leaping over the Works, all which concurring, ſo daunted the enemy, that they fled out of one Work into another, and ſo into the Caſtle; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcerned by the reſt of our Army, they all went over without any more ado, which ſo ripened the amazement of the enemy, that inſtantly they pulled down their bloody Colours, hung out a white Flag, had no power to make oppoſition, ſent a Drum for to crave <hi>Quarter,</hi> but before he could get out, and return, a great part of our foot were entred, they within had thrown down their Arms, and cryed for <hi>Quarter</hi> to our ſouldiers, which our ſouldiers (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining rather to booty then revenge) gave them, but ſtript they were to the purpoſe, all except Sir <hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> and his Lady, and ſome few more, and ſo we became Maſters of the Caſtle, and all within it; the ſouldiers finding plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of great value, the taking of which in a diſorderly manner could not then be prevented: There was taken about 400 priſoners in the Caſtle, beſides Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> the Governour, Col. <hi>Giles Strangewayes,</hi> formerly a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament, Sir <hi>Iohn Walcot,</hi> Col. <hi>Thornhill,</hi> and others of quality, and 18. pieces of Ordnance, and a Mortar-piece. The reducing of this place was of the greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernment, in regard of the influence it had upon the diſ-affected Clubmen in thoſe parts, who having the countenance of this garriſon, were made ſo much the more bold in their attempts and meetings.</p>
               <p>The ſouldiers ſpoil laſted all that day, and moſt part of the night, whoſe fair demeanour in the town of <hi>Sherborne</hi> during the ſiege, deſerves commendation, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that about ſixty townſmen who had families in the town, were in the Caſtle, and fought againſt them, yet not one of their houſes were plundered.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:66403:54"/>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday Auguſt</hi> 16. Being market-day, our ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with the booty they had got, kept a great market to the Country, who bought the goods of them; and all this day and the next was neceſſarily ſpent in ordering the diſpoſall of priſoners, and in conſidering what to do with the garriſon, which not above two or three dayes after was ordered to be ſlighted: And thus hath God led us into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtrong hold of equall difficulty and conſequence. In the reduction of which place, as elſewhere, the dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, induſtry and reſolution of Captain <hi>Dean,</hi> Comptroller of the Ordnance, deſerves to be had in memory.</p>

                  <hi>SHerborne</hi> being now by Gods bleſsing reduced, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of war was called, where the ſubject of the debate was, what ſhould be the next deſigne of the Army, the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> the reaſons upon which it was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſwade the Weſt, were, The purſuing of our Victory at <hi>Langport,</hi> the hindring of <hi>Goring</hi> from re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing his ſhattered Army in <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he might probably finde the <hi>Corniſh,</hi> being generally diſaffected to the Parliament, eaſily drawn, the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in perſon with them, and acting to that purpoſe) the miſeries of the people in the Weſt, and the neceſsities of <hi>Plimouth</hi> crying for preſent relief: beſides, it was urged on the negative of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that to go thither, was to hazard the whole Army, the Plague being ſore in the City, an hundred dying weekly, and that it was in moſt of the Villages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town. But on the other ſide, it was conſidered, That Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> being in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and able to draw into the field 3000 Horſe and Foot (leaving alſo ſufficient to defend that gariſon) Might, with the aſsiſtance of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Club-men (of whoſe diſaffection to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66403:55"/> there was ſufficient proof) and having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſending Forces and Recruits out of <hi>Wales,</hi> (which were eaſily to be tranſported over <hi>Severn</hi>) raiſe a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Army in the Midland parts, which might interrupt the proceedings of our Army, by marching on their Rear, when they were far advanced Weſt, vvhereby <hi>Goring</hi> being in the Front, they might come to be incloſed between two Armies, and ſo all intercourſe vvith <hi>London,</hi> and the Eaſtern parts would be thereby cut off; beſides, the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the place, as to the enemy, <hi>Briſtol</hi> being the only conſiderable Port the King had in the whole kingdom, for ſhipping, and trade, and riches; being withall his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine for all ſort of Ammunition: which ſhould it pleaſe God to make us maſters of, muſt needs prove ſadly fatal to his affairs, and would ſo be judged in this and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Kingdoms. What advantage it would be to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, both in reputation and reall improvements (it being juſtly reckoned in the firſt rank of populous and rich Cities in this Kingdom) was very clearly evident.</p>
               <p>Theſe and other like conſiderations being offered, for the preſent reducing of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> After long conſultation and debate, it was reſolved to march thither in order to the reducing of that place. After once this reſolution was taken, it was ſaid by the General: <hi>Seeing our Iudgements lead us to make</hi> Briſtol <hi>our next deſigne, as the greateſt ſervice we can do for the Publique; As for the Sickneſſe, let us truſt God with the Army, who will be as ready to protect us, in the Siege, from Infection, as in the Field, from the Bullet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon orders were given for the Army to march towards <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The Generall reſting all the next day at <hi>Sherborne</hi> to ſettle the buſineſs of the County. And on Monday (after Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> and the priſoners, together with the Club-leaders before mentioned, who were had in hold, were ſent away with a guard to <hi>London</hi>) the Army marched to <hi>Caſtle-Carew</hi> (ſave that Colonel <hi>Rainsborough</hi> with his own, and Colonel <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Regiments, and two pieces of Ordnance, was ſent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66403:55"/> to <hi>Nunney</hi> caſtle, for the reducing thereof) the reſt of the Army marched that night to <hi>Caſtle-Carew:</hi> the next day the General himſelf went to view <hi>Nunney</hi> caſtle, and found it to be a very ſtrong piece. The Head quarter was that night at <hi>Shepton-Mallet,</hi> but 5 miles from <hi>Carew,</hi> far enough for the Train, which was 4 miles behind from the quarters the night before: but to expedite, what might be, this deſigne againſt <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the relief of the country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, in the mean time, two thouſand Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons were ſent under the command of Commiſſary General <hi>Ireton,</hi> to preſerve the towns adjacent to <hi>Briſtol</hi> from plunder and firing, for the better accommodation of our quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the next day the Army marched to <hi>Chue,</hi> 9 miles, and ill way; and in relation to the ſtraiter ſiege, Meſſengers were ſent to the Vice-Admiral, Captain <hi>Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> riding about <hi>Milford Haven,</hi> to ſend ſhips into <hi>King-roade</hi> to block up <hi>Briſtol</hi> by ſea, as this Army intended to do by land. Some priſoners were taken by our Horſe near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> others came in voluntarily unto us; all agreeing, ſaid, the Enemy did not imagine our forces to be ſo near, or that we had any deſigne upon <hi>Briſtol.</hi> And by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter that came with a Meſsage from thence, they ſeemed to be ſo far from a belief thereof, that he ſaid he did not expect to finde us on that ſide <hi>Sherborne,</hi> and when he met our Horſe, he took them to be the Kings (not offering to ſound his trumpet as he ought to have done) that night there was a ſtrong party of Horſe and one Regiment of Foot diſpoſed at <hi>Hanham,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> on <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> ſide, by whom the Enemy was alarm'd. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this approach of ours, the Enemy fired <hi>Benminſter</hi> on <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> ſide, and burnt it down to the ground, as alſo divers houſes on <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> ſide. It was but the day before, when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was ſending out a party to relieve <hi>Barkley</hi>-caſtle, which was much ſtraitned by the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> forces; but the approach of our Horſe under Commiſſary <hi>Ireton</hi> diverted that deſigne.</p>
               <p>Thurſday, 21. in the morning, to encourage us in our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66403:56"/> engagements, we received intelligence of the ſurrender of <hi>Nunny</hi> caſtle to Colonel <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> upon condition to have liberty to go to their own houſes. By reaſon of the Train coming in ſo late; the Army reſted that day at <hi>Chue,</hi> ſave that another party of Horſe and Foot advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Benminſter,</hi> upon intelligence that the Prince inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to break through with his Horſe, and joyn with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> with which party the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-general</hi> went, viewed the Town, and appointed guards and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the Weſt ſide the River, and quartered himſelf at <hi>Keniſome</hi> that night; where divers Lords ſent for Paſſes to come out of the City and go beyond ſea, but upon good reaſon were denyed; it being a received opinion, that perſons of quality and great eſtate, in a beſieged town, rather encline to a timely yielding, then hazardous defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, when no relief is at hand.</p>
               <p>Friday the 22. there was a general rendezyouz of Horſe, and all that day was ſpent in ſetting of guards on <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire</hi> ſide, where the Countreymen maintained a paſſage at <hi>Clifton,</hi> the Head-quarter that night being removed to <hi>Hanham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saturday 23. the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole day, in the ſetling of quarters and guards on the other ſide of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> This day the Enemies Canon played from the great Fort, and <hi>Pryors</hi> Fort, but hurt none but one Dragoon, who had his thigh ſhot off. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſallied out alſo with a party of Horſe, but were beaten in again, where Sir <hi>Richard Crane</hi> was mortally wounded, who preſently after dyed of his wounds. The Head-quarter this night was removed to <hi>Stapleton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lords day, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. the Enemy about noon ſallied out again, at the Sally-port near <hi>Prior-hill</hi> Fort, in a full career, and were upon our Dragoons on the ſudden; yet by our Horſe comming on, were beaten back again, as alſo their Foot were, by the Foot of Colonel <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Brigade, made to retreat in diſorder, and worſe then they came forth, by the loſse of a Major and ſome others.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:66403:56"/>
               <p>Monday, 25. Warrants were iſsued out by the <hi>General,</hi> to Sir <hi>Iohn Horner,</hi> High Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> to raiſe the power of the County, which was much promoted by the intereſt and endeavours of Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> two worthy Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. This day the army had intelligence, that <hi>Goring,</hi> then about <hi>Collumpton</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> did ſeem to draw to a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, as if he intended a march to interrupt our ſiege. But Major-Gen. <hi>Maſsies</hi> Brigade of Horſe were quartered not far from <hi>Taunton,</hi> in ſuch an advantagious poſture, that the Enemy could not move, but he might flank them, and interrupt their motion, whileſt our Horſe might draw off to meet them, in caſe they ſhould attempt the forementioned deſigne.</p>
               <p>Tueſday, 26. four in the morning, the Enemy made a third ſally on <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> ſide, on a poſt of Colonel <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Brigade at <hi>Bedminſter;</hi> and through the negligence of the Officer that had then the command there, they took 10. and killed as many: towards a recompence of which affront, the ſame day, Captain <hi>Molleneux,</hi> a very valiant man (Captain Lieutenant to Colonel <hi>Butler</hi>) and with him another ſtout ſouldier, perceiving three gallant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers under their Works (whom afterwards they found to be Sir <hi>Bernard Aſhley,</hi> Colonel <hi>Daniel,</hi> and a third man) rode up to them, askt them who they were for, they ſwore, God dam them, for the King, and ſhot at ours: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, our men diſcharged their Piſtols at them, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and after ſome bickering took Sir <hi>Bernard Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> who dyed within few dayes of his wounds: But Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Daniel,</hi> though dangerouſly wounded, eſcaped from them.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday 27. the Enemy drew out the fourth time, about the cloſe of the evening, with intention to fall on our guards; which ours perceiving (&amp; they underſtanding that they were privie to their intention) they drew back to their Works. All this night, the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> were abroad upon the field, to be in readineſſe if any alarm ſhould happen.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:66403:57"/>
               <p>Thurſday 28. <hi>Rupert</hi> ſent out thoſe foot of ours, which were taken priſoners on <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> ſide, being in number ten, with a Trumpet, propounding alſo an exchange for Sir <hi>Bernard Aſhley,</hi> but the exchange was not hearkned to. This day we had intelligence of the Kings plundring of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and the cruel uſage of the people by his forces in thoſe parts, having unhappily eſcaped the Scotch and Northern horſe, out of <hi>Nottinghamſhire.</hi> Mean while, as an earneſt of the whole, the Fort at <hi>Portſhead point</hi> that had bin four dayes beſieged by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Kemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> of Colonel <hi>Weldens</hi> Regiment, with a party of Foot, was with ſix pieces of Ordnance this day ſurrendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; who managed that buſineſſe with much judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſolution; by the taking whereof the paſsage into <hi>King-road</hi> with our ſhips was made open.</p>
               <p>Friday 29. A Faſt was kept through the Army, to ſeek God for a bleſsing upon the deſignes againſt <hi>Briſtol:</hi> Mr. <hi>Del</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> kept the day at the Head quarter. The Enemy endeavoured to interrupt us by a ſally about noon time, upon our quarters near <hi>Lawfords-gate,</hi> where he took three or four ſouldiers. After the publick exerciſes a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of War was called; and it being agreed in the firſt place, to puniſh the vices of the Army, it was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether to ſtorm <hi>Briſtol</hi> or not; the debate was long, opinions various; however it was agreed, that all things ſhould be prepared in order to a ſtorm, and afterwards to take into further conſideration, whether to ſtorm or to intrench the Leaguer. In the midſt of theſe thoughts and reſolutions, tydings were brought the Army of the defeat given by <hi>Montroſſe</hi> to our Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that he was marched to <hi>Edenbrough</hi> in purſuit thereof; and that the King was now advanced to <hi>Bedford</hi> unfollowed, and was expected ſpeedily to raiſe the ſiege at <hi>Briſtol:</hi> and this day towards evening, the intelligence was confirmed by Letters from the Committee of both Kingdomes, of the Kings ſpeedy march towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> and probably to theſe parts. At the ſame time, his <hi>Excellency</hi> had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66403:57"/> that <hi>Goring</hi> in the Weſt advanced his quarters nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>Chard,</hi> and as it was verily thought, intended a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now was the Army in a great ſtraight, the whole ſtrength thereof being but ſufficient, and ſcarce that, for its preſent undertaking before <hi>Briſtol,</hi> utterly unable to check the Enemies conjunction, or attend their motions at any diſtance from the Leaguer: and though the further proceeding with the ſiege of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in this conjuncture of affairs ſeemed very hazardous, yet reſolving to abide the utmoſt, and not to give it over upon great looks, we put our ſelvs into the beſt condition we could to receive them, in caſe either or both ſhould attempt us.</p>
               <p>Lords day <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31. Captain <hi>Moulton,</hi> Admiral for the Iriſh coaſts (who was now come into <hi>Severne</hi>) came from aboard his ſhip to the <hi>General:</hi> expreſſed much readineſs to aſsiſt in the ſtorming of the City (if it were ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) with his Seamen. A debate was then had concerning the ſtorming of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and what might be done by water with the aſsiſtance of the Seamen. <hi>Gorings</hi> Letters from <hi>Exeter</hi> to Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> bearing date <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25. were this day intercepted: Wherein he writes, that in three weeks time he will be ready to interrupt <hi>Fairfax</hi> in his ſiege before <hi>Briſtol.</hi>

               <p>Tueſday, <hi>September</hi> 2. A Councel of War being called, and all the Colonels preſent; after a long debate, whether to ſtorm <hi>Briſtol</hi> or no, it was put to the queſtion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the affirmative; and for the manner of the ſtorm, it was referred to a Committee of the Colonels of the Army, to preſent in writing to the <hi>General</hi> the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be debated at a general Counſel of War: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Wedneſday <hi>September</hi> 3. the manner of the ſtorm was preſented in writing to the General, which was to be after this manner. Colonel <hi>Welden</hi> with his Brigade, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the four Regiments that were at <hi>Taunton,</hi> (viz. his own, colonel <hi>Inglesbies,</hi> colonel <hi>Forteſcues,</hi> and colonel <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Regiments, whoſe poſts were to make good <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire</hi> ſide,) was ordered to ſtorm in three places, <hi>viz.</hi> 200 men in the middle, 200 on each ſide, as forlorn hopes to begin the ſtorm; 20 Ladders to each place, two men to carry each Ladder, and to have 5 s. a piece; two Serjeants that attended the ſervice of the ladder, to have 20 s. a man; each muſquetire that followed the ladder, to carry a fagot, a Serjeant to command them, and to have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: 12 files of men with fire-arms and Pikes to follow the ladders to each place where the ſtorm was to be: thoſe to be commanded, each by a Captain and a Lieutenant; the Lieutenant to go before with five files, the Captain to ſecond him with the other ſeven files; the 200 men that were appointed to ſecond the ſtorm, to furniſh each party of them twenty Pioners, who were to march in their Rear; the 200 men, each to be commanded by a Field-Officer, and the Pioners each by a Serjeant: (thoſe Pioners were to throw down the Line, and make way for the horſe;) the Party that was to make good the Line, to poſſeſſe the guns, and turn them; A Gentleman of the Ordnance, Gunners and Matroſſes, to enter with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the Draw-bridge to be let down; two Regiments
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66403:58"/> and a half to ſtorm in after the Foot, if way were made. Much after this manner was the <hi>Generals</hi> Brigade, under Colonel <hi>Montague's</hi> command, conſiſting of the <hi>Generals,</hi> Col. <hi>Montagues,</hi> Col. <hi>Pickerings,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Wallers</hi> Regiments, to ſtorm on both ſides of <hi>Lawfords gate,</hi> both to the river <hi>Avon,</hi> and the leſſer river <hi>Froom;</hi> the bridge over <hi>Froom</hi> to be made good againſt horſe with Pikes, or to break it down.

               <p>The manner of the ſtorm being thus agreed on (though its probable, ſome more certain information might change the attempts from one place to another) the Souldiers were drawn out to try their inclination, in whom more courage, joy, and reſolution, could not appeare in men.

                     <p>Sir, for the ſervice of the Parliament, I have brought their Army before the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and do ſummon you in their names to render it, with all the Forts belonging to the ſame, into my hands for their uſe.</p>
                     <p>Having uſed this plain language, as the buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; I wiſh it may be as effectuall unto you, as it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to my ſelf; that I do a little expoſtulate with you about the ſurrender of the ſame, which I confeſſe is a way not common, and which I ſhould not have uſed, but in reſpect to ſuch a perſon, and to ſuch a place.

                     <p>Sir, the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is and will be where it ought to be; we fight to maintain it there. But the <hi>King</hi> miſled by evill Counſellours, or through a ſeduced heart, hath left his Parliament, under God, the beſt aſsurance of his Crown and Family: the maintaining of this Schiſme is the ground of this unhappy war on your part: and what ſad effects it hath produced in the three Kingdomes, is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all men. To maintain the rights of the Crown and Kingdom joyntly; a principal part whereof is, that the King in ſupream acts is not to be adviſed by men of whom the Law takes no notice, but by his Parliament, the great Counſel of the Kingdom, in whom (as much as man is capable of) he hears all his people as it were at once advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him; and in which multitude of Councellours lyes his ſafety, and his peoples intereſt: and to ſee him right in this, hath been the conſtant and faithfull endeavour of the Parliament, and to bring theſe wicked inſtruments to juſtice that have miſled him, is a principal ground of our fighting.</p>
                     <p>Sir, if God makes this clear to you, as he hath to us, I doubt not but he will give you a heart to deliver this place, notwithſtanding all the other conſiderations of honour, courage, fidelity, &amp;c. becauſe of their conſtancy and uſe in the preſent buſineſs, depends upon the right or wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this that hath been ſaid. And if upon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſhall ſurrender it, and ſave the loſſe of blood, or hazard the ſpoiling of ſuch a City; it would be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on glorious in it ſelf, and joyful to us, for reſtoring of you to the endeared affection to the Parliament, and people of <hi>England,</hi> the trueſt friend to your Family it hath in this World.</p>

               <p>This day, about 2000 well affected countreymen, who with many more, upon treaty with the <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> at the beginning of the ſiege, had engaged their aſsiſtance to make good the ſame; marched with ſome 36 Colours in the face of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> had quarters aſsigned them, and kept guards.

               <p>This anſwer being returned preſently after Dinner by the ſame Trumpeter, he was detained till eight at night; and then he brought this anſwer from the Prince, or to this effect in writing.</p>
               <p>That he hoped his Propoſitions had been ſuch as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no explanation: yet becauſe ſome doubts were made, he was willing to have the exceptions ſet down in writing, and his Highneſs would return anſwer.</p>
               <p>Monday, <hi>September</hi> 8. The <hi>General</hi> returned a particular Anſwer to every Article: which as to the ſouldiery was very honourable, and could not but be very acceptable to the Citizens: for the offer was moſt fair to the Citizens to oblige them to us, in caſe the conditions offered them were but known to them, as we hoped they would. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we had uſed means by our Spies to convey the ſame to them.</p>
               <p>In the interim all things were prepared for the ſtorm, every Commander viewing his Poſts: the Trumpet was detained beyond the time appointed, yet afterwards retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a deniall, but not poſitive. That night was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Army to fall on, but upon better conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it was held fit to put it off to another day, and only to alarm the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Tueſday, <hi>September</hi> 9. the Trumpet was ſent in again to let the Prince know, that if he did not immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what was offered, all that had paſſed ſhould be as no treaty, requiring the Trumpet to return by 12 of the clock, but notwithſtanding he was detained till 10 at night, and then returned with an unſatisfactory anſwer. Whereupon all things on our part were put in readineſs for a ſtorm. At 12 of the clock in the night the <hi>General</hi> went into the field to give order about the drawing out of our men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the ſtorm for the next morning.</p>
               <p>The Enemy being left inexcuſable for refuſing ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conditions as were offered; the whole Army Horſe and Foot being ſet in a poſture round the City, to fall on about two in the morning, <hi>September</hi> 10. the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

The Horſe that entred here, (beſides the Forlorn-hope) ſo valiantly led on by Captain <hi>Ireton,</hi> were in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parties commanded by Major <hi>Bethel,</hi> Major <hi>Alford,</hi> and Adjutant-general <hi>Flemming,</hi> being of Colonel <hi>Whalyes,</hi> Colonel <hi>Riches,</hi> and part of Colonel <hi>Graves</hi> his Regiments. And after the Line was broke down with the Pioneers, and a gap made in the ſame, our Horſe with undaunted courage entred, and within the Line met with a party of the Enemies Horſe, put them to a retreat, mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Colonel <hi>Taylor</hi> (formerly a Member of the Houſe of Commons) of which wounds he died, and took divers priſoners. This ſo diſheartned their Horſe, (perceiving withall our Foot to be maſter of the Line, and their men beaten off) that they never came on again to give one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66403:64"/> charge; but retreated and ſtood in a body, under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the great-fort, and <hi>Coulſtons</hi>-fort. In the mean while <hi>Pryors-hill-fort</hi> very obſtinately held out, playing fiercely with great and ſmall ſhot upon our men for two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Line was entred; our men all that time in like manner plying them hard with muſquet-ſhot in at the port-holes, untill they brought up Ladders to the Fort; but it being an high Work, many of the Ladders proved too ſhort, through which fault, ſome that got up were beaten down again. Notwithſtanding, this diſheartned them not, but up they went again upon greateſt danger and diſadvantage; ſome at laſt creeping in at the port-holes, and others got on the top of the Works, Captain <hi>Lagoe,</hi> of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Prides</hi> Regiment, being the firſt man that laid hold on the Colours; and in the end we forced the Enemy within to run below into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rooms of the Work, hoping to receive quarter; but our ſouldiers were ſo little prepared for to ſhew mercy, by the oppoſition that they met withall in the ſtorm, and the refuſal of quarter when it was offered, that they put to the ſword the Commander (one Major <hi>Price</hi> a Welchman) and almoſt all the Officers, Souldiers, and others in the Fort, except a very few, which at the entreaty of ſome of our Officers had their lives ſpared. By that time the Fort was gained the day began to break. And moſt happy it was that the ſtorm began ſo timely, for otherwiſe had the Enemy had day-light when we firſt entred, we could not haveſtood upon any ground to have attempted <hi>Pryors-hill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> in regard the Great-fort, and <hi>Coulſtons</hi>-fort on the one ſide, and the Caſtle on the otherſide, might have cut off our men as faſt as they had been drawn up, but being in the dark, they durſt not ſhoot for fear of killing their own men; their Horſe (during the ſtorm) being drawn in a body, between the Great-fort and <hi>Coulſtons</hi>-fort. But in the mean time the ſucceſs on <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> ſide was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto this, on this ſide, our forces there being put to a retreat, though they went on with much courage: the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66403:65"/> Works on that ſide were ſo high, that the Ladders could not near reach them, and the approach unto the Line of great diſadvantage. The Horſe deſigned to enter the line, in caſe it had pleaſed God to give us here alſo ſucceſſe, were, Lieut. General <hi>Cromwels</hi> Regiment, commanded by Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> Colonel Sir <hi>Robert Pyes,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Sheffields,</hi> both which Colonels in perſon attended the ſtorm, being impatient they had not fair opportunity of entering the Line, ſuch was their zeale to the ſervice.

               <p>That which moved the <hi>General</hi> to give ſuch favourable conditions, was meerly the preſervation of the City, which otherwiſe would have been conſumed by fire, if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had been driven to a deſperate condition.</p>
               <p>God, to ſhew the watchfulneſſe of his Providence over the <hi>General,</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-General,</hi> brought them into ſome danger, and delivered them out of the ſame graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, during the time of the Parley: For while they were both ſitting on the top of <hi>Pryors-hill</hi>-Fort, a peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſhot thither from the caſtle, and the bullet grazed upon the Fort within two hands breadth of them, but did them no hurt at all.</p>
               <p>This day, the well-affected Countrymen of <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:66403:66"/> to the number of about 3000. with ſome 30 Colours, appeared, expreſsing great forwardneſſe to ſerve the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; but the ſervice being over, they returned to their own homes.</p>
               <p>In this Storm we loſt ſeverall Officers, both of Horſe and Foot, and had many wounded; Major <hi>Bethel</hi> was ſhot at entring the Line, whom I have never occaſion to mention, but greatly to his honour: Of this wound he ſhortly after dyed. Captain <hi>Ireton,</hi> who led on the Forlorn hope at the ſtorm, was ſhot with a brace of bullets in the arm (and it broken thereby) but after enduring great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and pain for many moneths, he is through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing happily recovered. Major <hi>Cromwel,</hi> a valiant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Gentleman, (Major to Colonel <hi>Inglesby</hi>) was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Storm, whereof he afterwards dyed. Lieutenant-colonel <hi>Purefoy,</hi> of col. <hi>Forteſcues</hi> regiment, a very ſtout man, was ſlain upon the place. Captain <hi>Hill,</hi> of Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Wallers</hi> Regiment, ſlain at the ſtorm. Major <hi>Reade,</hi> Colonel <hi>Inglesbies</hi> Brother, and divers other Officers wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, Septemb.</hi> 11. The <hi>Prince,</hi> according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, marched out of the great Fort, as alſo many Ladies and perſons of quality, who had convoyes appointed them according to agreement. In the <hi>Prince</hi> his marching out, the <hi>General</hi> himſelf attended him about two miles. The <hi>Prince,</hi> after he was out of the Fort, declared which way he intended to go, and propounded <hi>Oxford;</hi> whither, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he, and all his company were ſafely convoyed: And becauſe he feared the riſing of the <hi>Club-men</hi> upon him, and not being ſecure enough in his Convoy, as he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; he deſired the <hi>General</hi> to let him have 1000 Arms for his Foot, engaging himſelf upon his honour, they ſhould injure no man therewith, only to make uſe of them (if need were) to keep themſelves from the violence of the people, and to return them back again: which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was allowed him, and ſo many as kept their arms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them again; but the greateſt part of them in their march running away, many of the arms were loſt. Divers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66403:67"/> perſons of quality that were in the town, deſired liberty to ſtay a while longer, till they could provide themſelves with Horſes and neceſſaries to march away, which civility the <hi>General</hi> did not deny them.</p>
               <p>A great appearance there was of the Countrey to ſee the marching away of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and extreamly cryed they out againſt the Prince, <hi>Give him no Quarter, Give him no Quarter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The goodneſs of God to the Army during this ſiege, in preſerving them from the ſickneſs was very remarkable: For when the Army was reſolved to march from <hi>Sherborne</hi> to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> one main objection there againſt it at that time was, leaſt the plague ſhould be thereby brought into the Army, but every mans conſcience and judgement being ſatisfied that the deſigne was good, and moſt for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the publick, and feazable in their opinion; they reſolved to truſt God what he would do with them, as to the ſickneſs that was much ſpread in thoſe parts. And whereas when the Army came before <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as likewiſe for many weeks before there dyed within the City above an hundred a week of the ſickneſs: nor could we quarter our forces in any town or village but the ſickneſs was in it: Yet during all this time not one Officer or Souldier in our Army dyed of the plague, that we could hear of, but one.</p>
               <p>What ordnance, arms, ammunition, and proviſions we found in the Forts, City, and Caſtle, I ſhall give you in the words of Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwels</hi> Letter to the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the Houſe of Commons: wherein alſo the Reader may finde, not only a confirmation, but an amplification of this Story, by ſome other particulars not yet mentioned; which Letter followeth.</p>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <opener>It hath pleaſed the <hi>General</hi> to give me in charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto you, a particular account of the taking of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the which I gladly undertake.</opener>
                     <p>After the finiſhing of that ſervice at <hi>Sherborne,</hi> it was diſputed at a counſell of war, whether we ſhould march
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66403:67"/> into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or to <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Amongſt other arguments, the leaving ſo conſiderable an Enemy at our backs, to march into the heart of the Kingdom; the undoing of the country about <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which was exceedingly haraſſed by the <hi>Prince</hi> his being but a fortnight thereabouts; the correſpondency he might hold in <hi>Wales,</hi> the poſsibility of uniting the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forces where they pleaſed, and eſpecially the drawing to an head the diſaffected Club-men of <hi>Somerſet, Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> when once our backs were towards them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations, together with the taking ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a place, ſo advantagious for the opening of Trade to <hi>London,</hi> did ſway the ballance, and beget that concluſion. When we came within four miles of the City, we had a new debate, Whether we ſhould endeavour to block it up, or make a regular Siege? The latter being over-ruled, Colonel <hi>Welden</hi> with his Brigade marched to <hi>Pile-hill,</hi> on the ſouth ſide of the city, being within musquet ſhot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where in a few dayes they made a good <hi>Quarter,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking the city. Upon our advance, the Enemy fired <hi>Bedminſter, Clifton,</hi> and ſome other <note n="*" place="margin">Which they did purpoſely to diſaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Army in point of quarter.</note> villages lying neer to the city, and would have fired more, if our unexpected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had not hindred. The <hi>General</hi> cauſed ſome Horſe and Dragoons under Commiſſary Gen. <hi>Ireton,</hi> to advance over <hi>Avon,</hi> to keep in the Enemy on the North ſide of the town, untill the Foot could come up; And after a day, the <hi>General,</hi> with Col. <hi>Montagues,</hi> and Col. <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Brigades, marched over at <hi>Kenſham</hi> to <hi>Stapleton,</hi> where he quartered that night: The next day, Colonel <hi>Montague</hi> (having his Poſt aſsigned) with his Brigade, was to ſecure all between the rivers <hi>From</hi> &amp; <hi>Avon,</hi> he came up to <hi>Lawfords Gate</hi> within musquet ſhot thereof: Col. <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Poſt was neer to <hi>Durdam Down,</hi> where the Dragooneers and three Regiments of horſe made good a Poſt upon the <hi>Down,</hi> between him and the river <hi>Avon,</hi> on his right hand, and from Colonel <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> quarters to <hi>From</hi> river, on his left. A part of Col. <hi>Birch,</hi> and Major gen. <hi>Skippons</hi> regiment were to maintain that Poſt. Theſe Poſts thus ſetled, our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66403:68"/> horſe were forced to be upon exceeding great duty, to ſtand by the Foot, leſt the Foot being ſo weak in all their poſts, might receive an affront. And truly herein we were very happy, that we ſhould receive ſo little loſſe by Sallies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the paucity of our men to make good the poſts, and the ſtrength of the Enemy within: By ſallies (which were three or four) I know not that we loſt thirty men in all the time of our ſiege. Of Officers of quality, only Colonel <hi>Okey</hi> was taken, by miſtake, going to the Enemy, thinking they had been friends; and Captain <hi>Guilliams</hi> ſlain in a charge. We took Sir <hi>Bernard Aſtley,</hi> and killed Sir <hi>Richard Crane</hi> (one very conſiderable with the Prince.) We had a Councel of war, concerning the ſtorming of the town, about eight dayes before we took it; and in that there appeared great unwillingnes to the work, through the unſeaſonablenes of the weather, and other apparent difficulties. Some inducements to bring us thither, was the report of the good affection of the Townſmen to us, but that did not anſwer expectation. Upon a ſecond conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was over-ruled for a Storm; which no ſooner concluded, but difficulties were removed, and all things ſeemed to favour the deſigne: And truly, there hath been ſeldome the like cheerfulneſſe to any work like to this, after it was once reſolved on. The day and houre of our ſtorm was appointed to be, Wedneſday morning the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. about one of the clock: We choſe to act it ſo early, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we hoped thereby to ſurpriſe the Enemy; with this reſolution alſo, to avoid confuſion, and falling foul one upon another; that when we had recovered the Line, and Forts upon it, we could not advance further untill day. The <hi>Generals</hi> ſignal unto ſtorm, was, the firing of ſtraw, and diſcharging four peece of canon at <hi>Priors-hill</hi>-fort: the ſignal was very well perceived of all, and truly the men went on with great reſolution, and very preſently recovered the Line, making way for the Horſe to enter. Colonel <hi>Montague,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Pickering,</hi> who ſtormed at <hi>Lawfords-gate,</hi> where was a Double-work, well filled with men and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66403:68"/> canon, preſently entred, and with great reſolution beat the Enemy from their works, and poſſeſſed their canon: their expedition was ſuch, that they forced the Enemy from their advantages, without any conſiderable loſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: They laid down the bridges for the horſe to enter, Major <hi>Desborough</hi> commanding the horſe, who very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly ſeconded the Foot: then, our Foot advanced to the city wals, where they poſſeſſed the Gate againſt the caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, whereinto were put an hundred men, who made it good. Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller,</hi> with his, and the <hi>Generals</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with no leſſe reſolution entred on the other ſide of <hi>Lawfords-gate,</hi> towards <hi>Avon</hi> river, and put themſelves into an immediate conjunction with the reſt of the Brigade. During this, Colonel <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> attempted <hi>Priors-hill</hi>-fort, and the Line downward towards <hi>Froom;</hi> and the Major-Generals Regiment being to ſtorm towards <hi>Froom</hi> river, Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> poſſeſſed the Line immediately, and beating the Enemy from it, made way for the horſe to enter. Colonel <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> who had the hardeſt task of all at <hi>Priors-hill</hi>-fort, attempted it, and fought neer three houres for it, and indeed there was great deſpair of carrying the place, it being exceeding high, a ladder of thirty rounds ſcarce reaching the top thereof; but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was ſuch, that notwithſtanding the inacceſsible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and difficulty, he would not give it over. The Enemy had four peece of canon upon it, which they plyed with round, and caſe-ſhot upon our men: his Lieut. colonel <hi>Bowen,</hi> and others, were two houres at Puſh of pike, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Palizadoes, but could not enter. Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> being entred the Line, and captain <hi>Ireton</hi> with a Forlorn of col. <hi>Rich</hi> his Regiment, interpoſing with his horſe, between the Enemies horſe, and col. <hi>Hamond,</hi> received a ſhot with two Piſtol bullets, which brake his arm: by which means, the entrance of col. <hi>Hamond</hi> did ſtorm the Fort on that part which was inward; by which means, col. <hi>Rainsborough</hi> and col. <hi>Hamonds</hi> men entred the Fort, and immediately put almoſt all the men in it to the ſword.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66403:69"/> And as this was the place of moſt difficulty, ſo of moſt loſſe to us on that ſide, and of very great honour to the undertaker. The Horſe did ſecond them with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Both theſe Colonels do acknowledge, that their interpoſition between the enemies Horſe, and their Foot, was a great means of obtaining of this ſtrong Fort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all the reſt of the Line to <hi>Froom</hi> river would have done us little good: And indeed, neither Horſe nor Foot would have ſtood in all that way in any manner of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had not the Fort been taken.</p>
                     <p>Major <hi>Bethels</hi> were the firſt horſe that entred the Line, who did behave himſelf gallantly, and was ſhot in the thigh, had one or two ſhot more, and had his horſe ſhot under him. Colonel <hi>Birch</hi> with his men, and the <hi>Major-Generals</hi> Regiment, entred with very good reſolution where their Poſt was; poſſeſsing the Enemies guns, and turning them upon them.</p>
                     <p>By this, all the Line from <hi>Priors-hill</hi>-fort to <hi>Avon</hi> (which was a full mile) with all the Forts, Ordnance and Bulwarks, were poſſeſſed by us, but one, wherein there were about an hundred and twenty men of the Enemy, which the <hi>General</hi> ſummoned, and all the men ſubmitted.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs on Colonel <hi>Weldens</hi> ſide did not anſwer with this. And although the Colonels, and other the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers, both horſe and foot, teſtified much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution as could be expected; Col. <hi>Welden,</hi> Col. <hi>Inglesby,</hi> Col. <hi>Herbert,</hi> and the reſt of the Colonels and Officers both of horſe and foot, doing what could be well looked for from men of honour; Yet what by reaſon of the height of the Works, which proved higher then report made them, and the ſhortnes of the Ladders, they were repulſed with the loſſe of about an hundred men: Col. <hi>Forteſcue's</hi> Lieutenant col. was killed, Major <hi>Cromwel</hi> dangerouſly ſhot, and two of <hi>Col. Inglesbies</hi> brothers hurt, with ſome Officers.</p>
                     <p>Being poſseſsed of thus much as hath been related, the Town was fired in three places by the Enemy, which we could not put out; which begat a great trouble in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66403:69"/> 
                        <hi>General,</hi> and us all, fearing to ſee ſo famous a City burnt to aſhes before our faces. Whilſt we were viewing ſo ſad a ſpectacle, and conſulting which way to make further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our ſucceſſe; the <hi>Prince</hi> ſent a Trumpet to the <hi>General,</hi> to deſire a Treaty for the ſurrender of the town: to which the <hi>General</hi> agreed, and deputed Col. <hi>Montague,</hi> Col. <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> and Col. <hi>Pickering</hi> for that ſervice, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with inſtructions to treat and conclude the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are theſe incloſed; for performance whereof, Hoſtages were mutually given. On Thurſday, about two of the clock in the afternoon, the <hi>Prince</hi> marched out, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a convoy of two Regiments of horſe from us, and making election of <hi>Oxford</hi> for the place he would go to, which he had liberty to do by his Articles.</p>
                     <p>The Canon which we have taken, are about 140. mounted, about 100 barrels of Powder already come to our hands, with a good quantity of Shot, Ammunition and Arms; we have found already between two and three thouſand Muskets. The Royal Fort had Victuals in it for one hundred and fifty men, for 320 dayes, the Caſtle victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled for neer half ſo long. The <hi>Prince</hi> had Foot of the garriſon, as the Major of the city informed me, 2500. and about 1000 Horſe, beſides the Trained bands of the town, and Auxiliaries, 1000. ſome ſay 1500. I heare but of one man that hath died of the Plague in all our army, although we have quartered amongſt, and in the midſt of infected perſons and places: We had not killed of ours in this ſtorm, nor all this ſiege, two hundred men.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have given you a true, but not a full account of this great buſines; wherein he that runs, may reade, that all this is none other than the work of GOD: he muſt be a very Atheiſt that doth not acknowledge it.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66403:74"/> (though many wounded:) colonel <hi>Herbert,</hi> as he valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led on his men to ſtorm, was ſhot through the Hat (narrowly eſcaping a greater danger:) there marched out of the caſtle above 500 Horſe and Foot: the County of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> not a little ſatisfied with the reducing of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, being a totall clearing of their County.</p>
               <p>How this high hand of God lifted up, and ſtretched forth againſt the Enemy, wrought upon them, I ſhall give you in ſome inſtances. A Lieut. col. of Sir <hi>Charles Lucas's,</hi> when he ſaw the garriſon was ſurrended, could not hold, but brake forth and ſwore to col. <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> He could be content to go to Hell, and be a Major there to plague the Roundheads; advancing in his helliſh Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in this latter ſpeech, but proportionable to his Eſſay in a former ſpeech after the firſt Summons, when he ſaid, God dam him he would go quick into hell, rather then yield the Caſtle to the Roundheads. Another of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the ſame caſtle ſaid to a captain of Horſe in our Army, He thought God was turned Roundhead, the Kings forces proſpered ſo ill.</p>
               <p>Theſe ought to be the greater engagements upon us, to ſanctifie that name of God which he proclaimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in theſe ſucceſſes: from whom elſe ſhall God have his glory?</p>

After ſome diſpute with the Governour, we entred the Town; I ſummoned the Caſtle, was denied, whereupon we fell to prepare our Batteries, which we could not perfect (ſome of our Guns being out of order) untill Friday following. Our Battery was ſix guns, which being finiſhed, after once firing of them round, I ſent him a ſecond Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for a Treaty, which they refuſed, whereupon we went on with our work, and made a breach in the wall neer the Black tower, which after about 200 ſhot, we thought ſtormable, and purpoſed on Monday morning to attempt it. On Sonday night about ten of the clock, the Governour beat a Parley, deſiring to treat: I agreed

His goodneſſe is, in this, much to be acknowledged; for the Caſtle was well manned, with 680 Horſe and Foot, there being neer 200 Gentlemen, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and their ſervants; Well victualled, with 1500 weight of Cheeſe, very great ſtore of Wheat and Beere, neer 20 Barrels of Powder, 7 Peeces of Canon, the Works were exceeding good and ſtrong. It is very likely it would have coſt much blood to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by ſtorm; we have not loſt 12 men.

                     <p>For the Caſtle of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> we begun our Batteries upon Saturday morning, which wrought ſo effectually, that a breach, wherein 30 men might go abreſt, was made; the Enemy ſallied out, and beat our men from our guns, which were ſoon recovered again: We plaid then with our granadoes from our Mortar-peeces, with the beſt effect that I have ſeen, which brake down the Manſion houſe in many places, cut off a Commiſsioner of theirs by the thighs, the moſt auſtere and wretched Inſtrument in that country, and at laſt blew up their Flag of defiance into the aire, and tore the Pinacle in peeces upon which it ſtood.</p>
                     <p>Summons being ſent as we entred upon this work, was refuſed by the Lord <hi>Ogle</hi> their Governour: And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Summons God ſent them, in the middle of their Battery; his Lady, to whom our <hi>Lieutenant gen.</hi> had given leave to come forth, and had gone ſome miles out of the town, died, by whom the Governour had during her life 1000. l. a yeare, now loſt by her death.</p>

                     <p>The Rooms, before the ſtorm (it ſeems) in both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, were all compleatly furniſhed, Proviſions for ſome years, rather then moneths; 400 quarters of Wheat, Bacon divers rooms full (containing hundreds of flitches) Cheeſe proportionable, with Oatmeal, Beef, Pork, Beer divers cellars full, and that very good.</p>
                     <p>A Bed in one room, furniſhed, that coſt 1300. l.

In the ſeverall rooms, and about the houſe, there were ſlain 74. and only one woman, the daughter of Doctor <hi>Griffith,</hi> who by her railing provoked our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (then in heat) into a further paſsion.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66403:81"/> the hands of Major <hi>Harriſon;</hi> (that godly and gallant Gentleman) and <hi>Robinſon</hi> the Player, who a little before the Storm, was known to be mocking and ſcorning the Parliament, &amp; our Army. Eight or nine Gentlewomen of rank, running forth together, were entertained by the Common ſouldiers ſomewhat courſly, yet not uncivilly, conſidering the action in hand; the plunder of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier continued till Tueſday night: one Souldier had 120 peeces in Gold for his ſhare, others Plate, others Jewels; amongſt the reſt, one got 3 bags of ſilver, which (he being not able to keep his own counſel) grew to be common pillage amongſt the reſt, and the fellow had but one half crown left for himſelf at laſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Souldiers ſold the Wheat to Country people, which they held up at good rates a while, but afterwards the Market fell, and there was ſome abatements for haſte. After that they ſold the houſhold-ſtuffe, whereof there was good ſtore; and the Country loaded away many Carts, and continued a great while fetching out all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of houſhold-ſtuffe, till they had fetched out all the Stools, Chairs, and other Lumber, all which they ſold to the Country people by peece-meale. In all theſe great houſes there was not one Iron bar left in al the windows (ſave only what was in the fire) before night. And the laſt work of all was the Lead, and by Thurſday morning they had hardly left one Gutter about the houſe. And what the Souldiers left, the Fire took hold on; which made more then ordinary haſte; leaving nothing but bare wals and chimnies in leſs then 20 houres, being occaſioned by the neglect of the Enemy, in quenching a Fire-ball of ours at firſt.</p>
                     <p>We know not how to give a juſt account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons that were within; for we have not three hundred priſoners, and it may be an hundred ſlain, whoſe bodies (ſome being covered with rubbiſh) came not to our view; only riding to the houſe on Tueſday night, we heard divers crying in Vaults for quarter, but our men
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66403:81"/> could neither come to them, nor they to us. But amongſt thoſe that we ſaw ſlain, one of their Officers lying on the ground, ſeeming ſo exceeding tall, was meaſured, and from his great toe to his crown was 9 foot in length.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis being preſſed by Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> arguing with him, broke out, and ſaid. <hi>That if the King had no more ground in England but</hi> Bazing-houſe, <hi>he would adventure as he did, and ſo maintain it to his uttermoſt,</hi> meaning with theſe Papiſts: comforting himſelf in this diſaſter, That <hi>Bazing-houſe</hi> was called Loyalty. But he was ſoon ſilenced in the queſtion concerning the King and Parliament, only hoping that the King might have a day again. And thus the Lord was pleaſed in a few hours to ſhew us what mortall ſeed all earthly glory grows upon, and how juſt and righteous the wayes of God are, who takes ſinners in their own ſnares, and lifteth up the heads of his diſpiſed people.</p>
                     <p>This is now the 20. garriſon that hath been taken in this Summer by this Army; and I believe moſt of them, the anſwer of the prayers and trophees of the faith of ſome of Gods ſervants. The Commander of this Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade having ſpent much time with God in prayer the night before the ſtorm, and ſeldome fighting without ſome text of Scripture to ſupport him. This time he reſted upon that bleſsed Word of God, written in the 115 <hi>Pſal.</hi> v. 8. <hi>They that make them are like unto them, ſo is every one that truſteth in them;</hi> which, with ſome verſes going before was now accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Houſe had ordered that the countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould carry away thoſe buildings, God Almighty had decreed touching that beforehand, nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a blaſt of winde to blow down the tottering wals and chimnies: Doubtleſs this providence of God hath a double voice, the one unto the Enemy, and the other unto us; the Lord help us with skill to improve it. I hope by this time the State hath a penny-worth for a penny, and I hope they will have full meaſure and running over.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66403:82"/> I wiſh that the payment and recruiting of this Army may not be ſlighted: It is an eaſie matter to grieve God, in our neglects towards him; and not hard to weary one another. What if the poor Souldier had ſome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, though ſmall, to leave as the acceptance of this ſervice, which is already begun by a <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Maynard.</note> worthy Member of this Houſe, who hath appointed ſome Medals to be made of gold to be beſtowed upon thoſe that ventured on the greateſt difficulties.</p>

               <p>But our onely GOD doth uſually temper ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Cups unto us; for in the cloſe of this glorious victory, the Death of Major <hi>Bethel</hi> was brought unto us, ſhot at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and tyred through want of ſleep, he is gone into the boſome of the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> whom he loved ſo deerly whilſt he lived.

The ſubject of the debate.</note> Saturday, <hi>October</hi> 25. the buſineſs that was in debate the day before at a counſel of war, was reaſſumed, and after much diſpute, it was reſolved, to march back with all our forces, on the Eaſt of <hi>Ex,</hi> to poſseſs <hi>Topſham,</hi> and ſettle ſtrong quarters on that ſide, before they advanced any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſt to relieve <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Not, but that the <hi>General</hi> and his Officers had that place much in their thoughts, but conceived it not fit to attempt it at this ſeaſon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Reaſons of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The reaſons inducing to this reſolution, were chiefly theſe, That nothing could be of that concernment, nor ſo conducing to the advantage of the Kingdom, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of this Army in an entire and healthful ſtate, for the future ſervice thereof. And ſuch was the ſickly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66403:85"/> ſtate of the Army at this time, as called rather for ſome relaxation, then ſuch extream hard duty, as the relief of Plymouth would have put them upon, eſpecially if they ſhould have ſtaid by it to make it good when they had done. Only to march thither and relieve the Town which (the Enemy had blockt up by divers regular and ſtrong forts, well manned and furniſhed) was ſuch an enterprize, as certainly required a more ſtrong and healthy ſtate of the Army. And when the Army had done this, ſhould they have come back again for winter-quarters? The Enemy ſo eaſily raiſed, might as quickly have ſat down again, and ſo the relief of <hi>Plymouth</hi> would not have been one jot advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Or ſhould the Army have taken up their winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in an Enemies countrey? (ſurrounded with ſtrong gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons both before and behinde them, beſides a potent Enemy in the field, judged (upon the beſt intelligence) to be equall, if not ſuperiour to them in number of horſe) it is equally evident to what an eminent hazard the Army muſt have been expoſed thereby. And what need was there to put that toile upon the Army? when his <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and the counſel of war well underſtood (though much was ſuggeſted to the contrary) that ſuch was the condition of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that they wanted not either men, ammunition or victuals, (having received plentiful proviſions ſent them by ſea) only were impatient to be ſet at liberty for trade.</p>
               <p>This day a party of horſe was ſent out towards <hi>Oke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> to diſcover where the Enemy was gone, who returned with intelligence, that <hi>Taveſtock</hi> was their head-quarters.</p>

I having ſummoned the place before, reſolved upon Sunday night to attempt it by ſtorm, which was agreed to be done in three places; The firſt Poſt was on the Weſt-gate, by Colonel <hi>Hamond;</hi> On the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the Town, by Lieut. colonel <hi>Pride;</hi> and on <hi>Tunſtal</hi> Church and Works by Col. <hi>Forteſcue:</hi> The time reſolved upon was in the evening; Our men fell on with great reſolution, to whom Colonel <hi>Lamberts</hi> Regiment was a Reſerve, and to alarm the Enemy elſewhere. Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> enred the Weſt-gate, where foure guns were planted, and two upon the Mill-poole, upon his Flank, (the Enemy firing his great guns but once) His men that had the Forlorn-hope did very gallantly (as indeed they did all) and went freely on, and beat off the Enemy, and poſſeſſed one Fort after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, viz. <hi>Mount-Flaggon,</hi> the <hi>Weſt-gate, Paradice-Fort,</hi> and beat off the Main guard, where were taken four Lieut. colonels; And ſo poſſeſſed the Town, from the <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> to <hi>Little-Dartmouth.</hi> In the interim, Lieut. colonel <hi>Pride</hi> attempted the North part of the Town, called <hi>Harneſſe;</hi> where beating off the Enemy, he entred, and took about 80 priſoners in it, and by it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all the North part of the Town, unto the Draw-bridge, which divided the North part from the reſt of the Town; where Colonel <hi>Hamonds</hi> men, and his, met. Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> with his men
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66403:95"/> attempted <hi>Tunſtal</hi> Church, which was very well manned, with above 100. men, and having in it 10. guns: His men, after ſome diſpute, with good reſolution entred the place, and poſſeſſed it. So that by this time the Enemy was beaten out of all, except the great Fort on the Eaſt ſide of the River, called <hi>Kingſworth-Fort,</hi> and the Caſtle, with the Fort that lay over the Caſtle at the mouth of the Harbour, called <hi>Gallants-Bower;</hi> to which laſt, the Governour, and the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> and as many as eſcaped us, fled. After they were forced from their Strengths out of the Town; the Governour comming back from the Caſtle, to ſee in what poſture the Town was, had a remarkable ſhot, as he was in the Boat: A Musquet-ſhot was made at the Boat, which pierced the Boat, and both the thighs of one that ſate next to him, and about three inches into his own thigh; whereupon he retreated to the Caſtle. Our Dragoons, with 2 companies of our Firelocks, and ſome Sea-men, were only to alarm <hi>Kingſworth-Fort,</hi> wherein was Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> with his Regiment, having in it 12 Guns, and 12 Barrels of Powder, and convenient proportion of Ammunition. This was a very ſtrong Fort, with about four good Bulwarks, ſtrong enough to make a troubleſome reſiſtance: But the Enemy came willingly to Terms; and to ſave time, I willingly condeſcended to let Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> march away, with the reſt, leaving the Arms, Ordnance, Ammunition, with all Proviſions in the Fort, to Me, and All engaging themſelves never to take up Arms more againſt the <hi>Parliament;</hi> which was accordingly performed. Next morning, being thus Maſter of all, but the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Gallants-Bower,</hi> I ſummoned that: The <hi>Governour</hi> was willing to liſten unto me; but I held him to thoſe terms, upon which after ſome diſpute, he yielded; which was, To deliver himſelf, and all Officers and Souldiers, upon Quarter. He ſent me out Colonel <hi>Seymour,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Denham,</hi> for Hoſtages, with whom came out the Earle of <hi>Newport,</hi> and all was this day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed accordingly. In this Fort and Caſtle were eleven Guns, with proportion of Ammunition and Proviſions: We have taken in the Harbour two Men of war; one belonging to the Governour of <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> with 12 guns, Burthen 200.

                  <hi>Saturday, Feb.</hi> 14. The Army martched from <hi>Crediton</hi> to <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> being ten miles, the Weather wet, and the way dirty; the Enemy but a little before our Forces came, were in the Towne, and were beaten out by the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Regiment, Lieutenant-colonel <hi>Wicks</hi> and others taken priſoners. Here his Excellency received intelligence, that the Enemy continued at <hi>Torrington,</hi> and were a conſiderable Army: upon which, <hi>Sunday Febr.</hi> 15. the Army martched early from <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> and had a Randezvouz two miles off in the way to <hi>Torrington.</hi> Our Horſe brought in divers priſoners to the Randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, who confeſt that the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> was in <hi>Torring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and that he had ſent out parties by three of the clock that morning to diſcover our motion; alſo one of our Spyes came thither out of <hi>Torrington</hi> that morning, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Excellency, that the Enemies whole Army was in and about <hi>Torrington,</hi> not expecting our being ſo neer.</p>
               <p>The Army was drawn to the Randezvouz, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to martch to <hi>Torrington,</hi> but the weather proving ſo bad, &amp; the bridges being broken down by the enemy, and

The Enemy at the ſame time advanced out of <hi>Cornwal</hi> with all the Foot to <hi>Torrington,</hi> about which their Horſe did lye before, and began to fortifie the Towne: Their intentions therein, as we conceived, and doe ſince further find, were by the advantage of this place and their Garriſon of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> ſo neer it, to make this part of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> more ſurely theirs, and more difficult for us to come into, and lying ſo much the neerer to <hi>Exceſter</hi> (againſt which they ſuppoſed this Army wholly engaged) to take their beſt advantages from hence and from <hi>Chimley,</hi> which they meant alſo to have poſſeſſed, to relieve <hi>Exceſter</hi> on the North ſide, or disturb us in the Siege; and it is probable they might have a further purpoſe in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66403:103"/> here, to ſecure the landing of <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Welſh</hi> ſupplies ſo much the forwarder towards the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, I advanced from <hi>Crediton</hi> to <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> where by many priſoners I was informed, That the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had hereabouts foure thouſand Horſe, and three thouſand Foot; Wee beleeved them to be about two thouſand Foot or upwards, and three thouſand Horſe; the extreame foulneſſe of Weather that day and the next, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned me not to advance from about <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> for the next night, ſave only one Foot Quarter and an Horſe Guard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>Ring-Aſh,</hi> three miles towards the Enemy, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Randezvouz ſo much the neerer to them; for the day following I understood by the beſt Intelligence, that the Enemy was reſolved to make good their ſtation, and ſet their reſt upon it to fight us there if we would come up to them; and truly men in their condition could not hope (al things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to have more for it, their Horſe for nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſuperior to what I brought up with me, their Foot, as I find ſince, not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; and if they could with all their force make good this Towne, and put us to lye in the Field, there being no Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges neer it that could ſhelter the Army, the wet weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, which was then moſt likely, would have forced us to draw back and make our fire Armes little uſefull, either for aſſault or defence; and beſides, we were like, for matter of proviſions, to be forced to draw off firſt, they having both by their posture, with the plentifull Country of <hi>Cornwal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and a River at their backs, ſecuring alſo a good part of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> unto them, and by their ſtrength of Horſe, much advantage for longer ſubſistence then we; and we by the barrenneſſe of the place where we muſt have lyen before them, eſpecially for Horſe meat, their Garriſon of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> lying partly behind us, their Horſe more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then ours, which might with ſtronger parties cut off our ſupplyes, had little poſſibility to ſubſiſt long before them. Theſe Conſiderations we had in our eye to diſcourage us from going on, as I beleeve they had to encourage them to ſtand; yet on the other ſide, finding that by reaſon of the barrenneſſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66403:104"/> and long exhausting of our Quarters behind us, we could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep our Horſe ſo cloſe together as to lye ſafe ſo neer the Enemy, nor indeed find ſubſistence for the Army, either where we were, or in any other Quarters more backward, where we could lye ſo as to ſecure the Siege of <hi>Exceſter</hi> from reliefe, and upon all conſiderations conceiving the affaires of the Kingdome did require us, and God by all did call us to make a preſent attempt upon the Enemy; Wee reſolved to goe on, to try what God would doe for us, and truſt him for weather, ſubſistence and all things.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, on Monday morning I drew out the Army to an early Randezvouz at <hi>Ring-aſh,</hi> within ſix miles of the Enemy; the weather ſtill continued very wet, and ſo by all ſignes was like to hold till we were advanced from the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz; but ſuddenly, when we were upon Martch, it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation, began to be faire and dry, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, whereas we had ſcarce ſeene one faire blaſt for many dayes before. The Enemy (as we understood by the way) had all their Horſe drawne together about <hi>Torrington,</hi> and with their foot prepared to defend the Towne, which they had fortified with good barricadoes of earth caſt up at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry avenew, and a competent line patcht up round about it, their Horſe ſtanding by to flanke the ſame, and ſome within to ſcoure the Streets. Our Forlorne-Hope had order to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>Stephenſon Parke,</hi> about a mile from the Towne, and there to ſtay for the drawing up of the Army, there being no other place fit for that purpoſe neerer to the Towne on that ſide we came on. But when we came neere, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Enemy had with two hundred Dragoons poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the Houſe in the Parke, and were fortifying it, being of it ſelfe very ſtrong; but upon our neerer approach, their Dragoons quitted the Houſe, and our Forlorn-Hope falling on them, took many priſoners, and purſuing them neer the Towne, were engaged ſo far as they could not well draw back to the Parke, which occaſioned the ſending up of ſtronger Parties to make them good where they were, or bring them off; and at laſt, there being ſome feare that the Enemy
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66403:104"/> would draw about them and hem them in, Colonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was ſent up with three Regiments of Foot, being his owne, Colonel <hi>Harlowes,</hi> and mine, and ſome more Horſe to lye for reſerves unto them; by which time the night was growne on, ſo that it was not thought fit, unleſſe the Enemy appeared to be drawing away, to attempt any thing further upon the Towne till morning, in regard none of us knew the ground, nor the advantages or diſadvantages of it; but about nine of the clock, there being ſome apprehenſion of the Enemies drawing away, by reaſon of their drawing back ſome Out-guards, ſmall Parties were ſent out towards the Townes end to make a certaine diſcovery, which going very neer their Works, before the Enemy made any firing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt entertained with a great Volley of ſhot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſuppoſed to be engaged, ſtronger Parties were ſent up to relieve them, and alter them the three Regiments went up for reſerves, till at laſt they fell on in earneſt; after very hot firings, our men comming up to the Barricadoes and Line, the diſpute continued long at puſh of Pike and with butt ends of Muskets, till at laſt it pleaſed God to make the Enemy fly from their Works, and give our men the entrance: After which our men were twice repulſed by their Horſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all driven out againe, but Colonel <hi>Hammond</hi> with ſome other Officers and a few Souldiers, made a ſtop at the Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, and ſo making good their re-entrance, rallyed their men and went on againe, Major <hi>Stephens</hi> with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Hope of Horſe comming ſeaſonably up to ſecond them, the Enemies Foot ran ſeverall wayes, moſt of them leaving their Armes, but moſt of their Officers, with the aſſistance of Horſe, made good their owne retreat out of the Towne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Bridge, and taking the advantage of ſtraight paſſages, to make often ſtands againſt our men, gave time for many of their Foot to get over the Bridge; Their Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Towne, after ſome attempts at other Avenues, to have broken in againe upon us, being repulſed, at laſt went all away over another Bridge, and at ſeverall other paſſes of the River, and all fell Westward; the ground where their

Foot, and a thouſand Horſe in readineſſe, and three months pay provided for them, beſides ten thouſand pound in bullion daily expected, a Mint being ready to coyne the ſame, but yet intimated a conveniency in the giving a little more time for their comming over; whereupon Sir <hi>John Culpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> was to goe in all haste to <hi>France</hi> upon <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, as is ſuppoſed, on purpoſe either to haſten al, or a good part of thoſe Forces over; I think it will be very good that as much Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as may be obtained be hastened into thoſe parts; I ſhall upon this Information, and the good ſucceſſe God hath been pleaſed to give us, ſo diſpoſe of the Army, as may moſt effectually conduce to a ſpeedy and through ſettlement of theſe Westerne parts of the Kingdome; therefore I deſire you againe to have a ſpeciall care, that the Forces about <hi>Oxford</hi> be not permitted to range into theſe parts, when the Army is like to be engaged ſo far Weſt, leſt it occaſion the diviſion of our Forces, and hinder the accompliſhment of that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to effect.

That Party of the Enemy was commanded by Sir <hi>James Smith,</hi> and had they not taken the nick of time and gone away when they did, they had been all taken in their retreat by our Horſe, which came ſo inſtantly after them, that they had like to have gained the paſſe. <note place="margin">The Enemy retreating.</note> This night his Excellency had intelligence, that the Enemy had quit <hi>Bodman</hi> about ten at night, Horſe and Foot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating yet further Weſt, <note place="margin">Whither <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> went.</note> and that the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> (otherwiſe Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi>) brought up the Reare, moſt of the men (poore creatures) being drunk when they went away, to mend their hard fortune.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66403:112"/> reſolved to break through, for now was the time for them to doe it, or never; for one dayes advance more, would drive them into ſo narrow a compaſſe, that it was in vain to think of it afterwards. This was made known to the Country people, at their meeting upon the <hi>Downes,</hi> whereupon there were above a thouſand of them expreſt much willingneſſe to aſſiſt in the blocking up of all paſſages and wayes, that might prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies breaking through; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Letters being ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and read unto them by Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> did much heighten their reſolution to aide and aſſiſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Forreigners; and not onely ſo, but the forwardneſſe they expreſt to aſſiſt againſt the preſent Enemy in their Country, with the great joy and content they ſhewed at the Armies being come thither for their reliefe, (ſaying they had not ſeen ſuch a day this three yeers) was beyond expectation: and certainly there was the great hand and good providence of God in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune bringing in of this Packet of Letters thither, whereby the Country was ſo much wonne unto us. The happy event of this day had a further acceſſion by the news of the taking of <hi>Corfe</hi> Caſtle by a ſtratagem and ſtorm, managed by the diſcretion of that worthy &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Gentleman, Colonel <hi>Bingham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Poole.</hi>

               <p>Strict Orders were given to all our Forces upon the Guards to be very vigilant this night, and on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a martch was intended for the whole Army.</p>

               <p>But by reaſon the General and part of the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated back this day to <hi>Bodman,</hi> the Malignants began to rejoyce, upon preſumption that the Army was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, and hereof they were ſo confident, that they conveyed it up with much expedition to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where it is certaine, they had publick rejoycing for the great Victory obtained againſt FAIRFAX his Forces in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>

Though the day were very rainy, the Army marched to other Quarters, within ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles of <hi>Truro,</hi> to Saint <hi>Stephens,</hi> Saint <hi>Blaſe,</hi> and other parts: Major-General <hi>Pert</hi> was brought to the head Quarters ſore wounded, he was a proper, ſtout, gallant man; all meanes was uſed for his recovery, if it might have been. He ſatisfied divers there, that thoſe men that were ſo routed were the Princes Regiment, (moſt of them Gentlemen and Reformadoes:) That the Summons ſent from the General to the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> was not publiſhed: The Copy of the Summons being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66403:113"/> read unto him, he ſaid, that the conditions therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned would be readily accepted by the Souldiery, and if it were once publiſhed in the Army, and refuſed by the Officers, it would break them to pieces. In Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Pert's</hi> pocket there was found a Letter intended to be ſent to the Lords that were about the Prince, to this purpoſe: <hi>That the Kings condition is ſo low, is not our fault; we are not able to break through the Enemy, nor ſtrong enough to fight them, therefore are reſolved to compound for our ſelves, and leave you to doe what you pleaſe,</hi>
               </p>

                        <note place="margin">His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Reply.</note> I Should moſt truly and freely informe your Lordſhip the beſt I could, in any thing that might lead you to a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of things, in order to the peace of the Kingdome, or the reall good of your ſelfe and thoſe with you, ſo farre as may ſtand with my truſt and duty to the publick, to what I conceive your more certaine knowledge of that your deſire to be informed in concerning the Kings offers to the Parliament, would not be prejudiciall: But the truth is, I can give you no other ſatisfaction or aſſurance therein then this: That the King hath made ſome offers to the Parliament; and amongst them, one concerning the <hi>Militia.</hi> Something to the purpoſe, as you ſay you have heard; but the juſt certainty what his laſt overtures are, or how far they are advanced to a generall accord, I cannot at preſent certifie. I do not heare they have proceeded ſo farre as to a Treaty; And I beleeve, that as the Parliament may be diſcouraged from the way of Treaty by former experiences of the fruitleſneſſe thereof, and the ill uſe the ſame hath been deſigned or driven unto, <hi>viz.</hi> onely to gaine advantages for Warre, without reall intentions for Peace; ſo the late overtures that way are the leſſe like to be ſuccesfull, by reaſon of the cleer and certaine diſcoveries the Parliament have had, That his Majesty at the ſame time was and is labouring by Agents in all parts to draw in Forraigne Forces, and eſpecially that the Earle of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> by Commiſſion from his Majesty, had concluded a Peace with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, on tearmes extreamly diſhonourable and prejudiciall, upon the onely condition of ſending over Force under the command of that Lord, to invade <hi>England;</hi> whereof I preſume you cannot but have heard. And though his Majesty did in a Letter to the Parliament, diſavow any ſuch agreement, and pretended he had given order to the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> for the attainting and impeaching the Earle
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66403:115"/> of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> of high Treaſon, for what he had done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: yet by late diſcoveries to the Parliament, and eſpecially by Letters intercepted the other day at <hi>Padſtow,</hi> from the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and others, to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> your ſelfe, Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> the Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> and others, it is moſt cleer and evident, that the arresting of the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was onely for a preſent colour to ſalve reputation with the people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their deluſion till deſignes were ripe for execution; for the ſame peace is fully concluded with the Rebels, the King to have the ayde conditioned upon the ſame agreement, and the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> at liberty againe; and to command that Force in chiefe.</p>
                     <p>Now for the overture of a meeting, to treat further about the Propoſitions I ſent, though I know nothing materiall that I can adde or alter, except in circumstances, yet I ſhall not refuſe or decline ſuch a meeting, or ought elſe that probably tends to the ſaving of blood, or further miſery to any, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the meeting be ſpeedily, and number of perſons not to exceed four or five.

I question not, nor yet ſhall, I hope, be much moved with the reſolution of your men; I preſume not on former ſucceſſes nor preſent advantage in fleſhly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but deſire to truſt in God alone, whoſe favour and bleſſing to this Army above others, I doe not account in what is paſt, or expect in future, to be for any precedence in merit or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ours, whereby we ſhould be more pleaſing to him then others, but from his owne Free grace and goodneſſe towards his people, whoſe welfare, with the common good of the

               <p>Moreover, beſides the proportion this Anſwer might beare to the better information of the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> his Excellency (to ſatisfie him more fully) commanded ſome of the Regiments to advance this day to <hi>Tregny</hi> (an ill ſigne of a Ceſſation) and the next day the Army advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced two ſeverall wayes, part of it following to <hi>Tregny,</hi> (the head Quarter that night) another part of it to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and thoſe parts. But ſuch was the force of the Lord <hi>Hopton's</hi> imagination upon his owne Souldiers, that they inſtead of asking, acted a Ceſſation; when our Forlorne of Horſe comming neer theirs, not far from <hi>Probus,</hi> they did not endeavour to put themſelves in order to receive us, nor did they make any teſiſtance, but ſtood ſtill: our men much wondring thereat. And what was the cauſe? but a Ceſſation between the Armies (as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, or would ſeem to beleeve) for ſo ſoon as our men came neer, they cryed, <hi>A Ceſſation, a Ceſſation:</hi> ours cryed, <hi>No, no, there was none:</hi> and much adoe had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-generall <hi>Ireton,</hi> and other Officers, to perſwade them there was none; notwithſtanding, ſince they were ſo poſſeſſed and deluded, we wiſht them to be gone, and we would take no advantage of them. The Enemy expreſſing much ſorrow (that there was not a Ceſſation as they were informed) retired, ſeeming alſo to be ſomewhat affected, that they had ſo noble and ingenuous an Enemy, that took not this advantage to do them any hurt, as we might have done, there being no Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> ſeeing his ſtratagem would not take, but he muſt beg a Ceſſation if he would have it,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66403:116"/> and that his men were ſo ſtartled at the advance of our Army, <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> ſends for a Treaty.</note> ſent this night about twelve of the clock, for a Treaty, naming the place, <hi>Treſillian-Bridge,</hi> if his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency approved of it: The Trumpet was returned about three in the morning, That the General did heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to a Treaty, and would appoint Commiſſioners to meet at the place propoſed by the Lord <hi>Hopton.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Commiſſioners on both ſides were nominated to meet at nine the next day, being <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning (<hi>March</hi> 10.) But the General being unwilling to loſe time, gave Orders for a martch: accordingly the Army that <hi>Tueſday</hi> advanced by breake of day, and martched to a Randezvouz within two miles of <hi>Truro</hi> by ten of the clock, where the Lord <hi>Hopton's</hi> Trumpeter brought a ſafe Conduct for our Commiſſioners, and they having received the like from us, a Ceſſation was agreed to; but withall, a Meſſage was ſent to the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> from the General, That he intended to quarter his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Truro</hi> and Saint <hi>Allen</hi> that night, which he thought fit to give him notice of, that none of his Forces might be left in the Towne when our Souldiers entred. This much diſreliſhed with the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners that he ſent, had much reluctancy againſt it. The General, upon conference with the Commiſſioners, was content to let them have Saint <hi>Allen</hi> for their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; his Excellency reſerving ſtill <hi>Truro</hi> (the prime Quarter) to himſelfe. And here we had the Enemy in a pound, ſo that he had but ſix miles bredth to break through, if he attempted it. And now we having the Paſſe at <hi>Truro,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> drew his Forces to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more Weſtward, and the Treaty was adjourned till next Morning, and a Ceſſation obſerved on both Sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 11. The Commiſſioners on both ſides met againe, but could not make any great progreſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaty; the Ceſſation was continued for a day longer: about one hundred and twenty Muſquetteers
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66403:116"/> came in this day with their Armes, and Colours flying, being of Colonel <hi>Trevanian's</hi> Regiment: alſo divers Colonels, Knights and Gentlemen of quality, ſent to the General, making knowne their deſires, to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the protection of the Parliament; which ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned Colonel <hi>Trevanian,</hi> then with his Regiment at <hi>Perin,</hi> that late that evening he ſent unto his Excellency, deſiring he might be included in the Treaty with the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and have the ſame conditions that other Officers were to have. Theſe things ſo operated with the Governour of Saint <hi>Mawes</hi> Caſtle, a principall Fort that had a great command of the Haven at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> that he ſent to the General to be received into favour: And although <hi>Arrundell</hi> the Governour of <hi>Pendennis,</hi> ſent to command him to come into the Caſtle of <hi>Pendennis,</hi> he fearing ſome evill intended againſt him, refuſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his former deſire: whereupon the General ſent him conditions, with a Summons; which were accepted, and he agreed to ſurrender.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the Ceſſation, our Troopers mixed with the Enemies; and upon this bruit abroad (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground) that the Enemies Troopers ſhould loſe their Horſes, they to make ſome advantage of them, courſed good ſtore of their beſt Horſes to our men.</p>
               <p>By twelve of the clock this night, all the materiall poynts of the Treaty were concluded, matters of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance onely remained, which yet were ſo neceſſary to be concluded, in order to the perfecting of the Treaty, that the next day was allowed (and the Ceſſation continued) for the finiſhing thereof. When the Treaty was fully ended, and Hoſtages appointed, the ſame day Saint <hi>Mawes</hi> Caſtle was ſurrendred, and thirteen pieces of Ordnance in it (whereof two great Braſſe Pieces, of about four thouſand weight apiece) and our Foot were ſent to poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p>The Treaty being thus ended, with great joy did the Enemies Officers receive our conditions, and wiſht they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66403:117"/> had ſooner known our intentions towards them. Thoſe that ſeemed moſt diſcontented, were the common Troopers that were to be diſmounted, who therefore to mend their conditions, had changed away their beſt Horſes, for advantage, before the disbanding. And it is not to be credited, how much our Army did get into the Enemies eſteem during the Ceſſation, and what ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull expreſſions many of them did make, that they han been ſo deluded concerning our carriage; ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſing, that the civility of our Army had been ever till now concealed from them. Officers and Souldiers unanimouſly deſired imployment for <hi>Jreland;</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take the Sacrament Oath (for that they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) or to enter into what other Obligation ſhould be thought fit, That as they would never beare Armes againſt the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they would not, if they were imployed in <hi>Jreland</hi> by the Parliament, deſiſt from purſuing of their commands againſt the <hi>Jriſh</hi> Rebels, upon any countermand or other invitation of the Kings: affirming, that they had ſufficiently ſmarted already for being enticed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> was appointed to be the day of disbanding, which yet of very neceſſity was put off till the next day; in the meane time one hundred and twenty more of the Enemies Foot, with Colours, came in; and now all things being agreed, the Commiſſioners of both ſides ſupt this night with the General.</p>
               <p>The next day, which was appointed for the Disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the <hi>Lords day,</hi> in which the Army would have been glad to have reſted, but in regard time was preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the country ſuffered ſo much by the Enemies Forces that lay upon them, they by good warrant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred mercy and neceſſity before ſacrifice, and the <hi>French</hi> Regiment, under the command of <hi>Monſieur Laplane,</hi> which was to be the firſt disbanded, was that day brought to the place appointed for Disbanding. Their Horſes were very poore, they having before, by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66403:117"/> private contracts, put off the beſt of them. There were about three hundred diſmounted; but they having made their markets before, moſt of their Horſes (as was but juſt) were turned back upon their owne hands, as not worth the twenty ſhillings an Horſe, which they were to receive according to the agreement. In the ſpace of five dayes more was the work finiſhed, and the whole Field force of the Enemy in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> disbanded; <hi>viz.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> two Brigades of Horſe. <hi>Tueſday</hi> 17. the two Brigades of the Lord <hi>Cleveland's</hi> and Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Web's.

The number of Brigades in all that were disbanded, were nine; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Brigade, conſiſting of three Regiments: The Lord <hi>Wentmorth's</hi> Brigade, conſiſting of four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Sir <hi>James Smith's</hi> Brigade, conſiſting of three Regiments: The Lord <hi>Cleveland's</hi> Brigade, conſiſting of four Regiments: Major-General <hi>Web's</hi> of three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments: The Lord <hi>Hopton's</hi> Brigade, commanded by Colonel <hi>Bovile:</hi> The Lord <hi>Goring's</hi> Brigade, of five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments: The Princes Life-guard, conſiſting of nine Troops, being ſeven hundred men, armed: Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil's</hi> Reformadoes.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66403:118"/> Propoſitions, to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> and the Army under his command (A true Copy whereof I have here incloſed) being encouraged thereunto by ſome of the Enemies Officers and Souldiers, who came in to me, and informed of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinableneſſe to Conditions; and hoping thereby either to bring them to ſuch termes as ſhould be to your advantage, or would diſtract and weaken them; and withall underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the intercepted Letters I ſent you, that an <hi>Iriſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry</hi> was ready to be ſhipt for <hi>England,</hi> I thought fit to try all meanes which in probability might break their Body of <hi>Cavalry</hi> upon the place.

               <p>Many Gentlemen of quality.</p>
               <p>Ninety and ſix common Souldiers from <hi>Peryn</hi> with Armes.</p>
               <p>Twelve more followed them.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:66403:123"/>
               <p>One hundred more with their Arms and Colours, of Colonel <hi>Trevanian's</hi> Regiment.</p>
               <p>One hundred Officers and ſouldiers of Colonel <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernoon's</hi> Regiment, <hi>Falmouth</hi> by this means, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of St <hi>Mawes,</hi> was ours on one ſide the Harbour.</p>
               <p>Now having given you the Narrative, give me leave to make ſome few obſervations on this ſuccesfull progreſſe, even to the Lands end, which may well be the ſubject of greateſt admiration and thankfulneſſe: The hard task the Army had in forcing up ſo great a Body as 5000 of the Enemies Horſe, into ſuch a narrow neck of land, through a Country ſo cragged, in ſuch a ſeaſon of the yeer, the ground all covered over with Snow, the wayes ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the Weather ſo bitter cold, by a hard froſt of that continuance, as had not been knowne for many yeers before, may well be compared with <hi>Hannibal's</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his paſſage into <hi>Italy</hi> through the frozen <hi>Alps</hi> with Fire and Vinegar. That five thouſand Horſe and more ſhould be forced to capitulate and yeeld themſelves to an Army comming ſhort of that number in Horſe, is that which Hiſtory can hardly paralell, and Poſterity will ſcarce beleeve. And the benefit is as great as the wonder: For had this Body of Horſe eſcaped into the Mid-land parts, they might in probability have much protracted the Warre: and if they, the Lord <hi>Aſhlye's</hi> Foot, and the Kings other Forces about <hi>Oxford</hi> had joyned together, they would have been very conſiderable in the Field, and ſo would neceſſarily have occaſioned the diverſion of the Army from the work they had in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Weſt, which was of that vaſt importance to the Kingdom, conſidering the Negotiations that were in <hi>France &amp; Ireland,</hi> for the preſent bringing over Forces thither (as by the intercepted Letters from thoſe parts ſeverally did appeare) that nothing could be greater: But by this good hand of God upon us, this Body of the Enemy is ſecured, their joyning prevented, and all the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66403:124"/> miſchiefe that would have enſued thereupon, and <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal</hi> reduced: Which laſt particular, that you may ſee what a conſiderable ſumme (alone and by it ſelfe) it amounts unto; caſt it up and conſider it, as it was a Country having convenient Ports &amp; Harbours both for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe naturall ſcituation was very ſtrong and apt for defence, being all very mountainous, and enwrapt with the Sea on all ſides, except toward <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and there bounded by the River <hi>Tamar,</hi> which in a right line, runs almoſt from Sea to Sea. From which advantages, it hath been in ancient times, one of the laſt places of retreat in the Kingdome, and hath ever made ſaving conditions for it ſelfe in thoſe overflowing inundations both of <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi> Since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our late Warres, it and its Forces have been more then once fatally diſaſtrous to our former Armies, and had ever been from the beginning of the Warres in the poſſeſſion of the Enemy, the people more generally diſaffected to the Parliament then any other part of the Kingdome, from whence the King, as from a never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spring, was conſtantly ſupplied with a choyce and able Infantry.</p>
               <p>All which particulars whoſoever doth conſider, will acknowledge, that the reducing of this County was as difficult as deſirable: And this is another happy fruit of the disbanding thoſe Horſe, and not only the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> but the abſolute conqueſt of the Weſt of <hi>England;</hi> moſt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Garriſons there onely waiting to ſee what would become of theſe Horſe, upon whom they depended for reliefe.</p>
               <p>All which conſidered and put together, this ſervice may well live a laſting Monument, to the glory of God, and the honour of the Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Moreover, during this ſpace, while the Enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were disbanding, as an additionall to the occurrences of theſe five dayes, <hi>Monday</hi> 16. another Packet of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66403:124"/> Lord <hi>Glamorgan's</hi> taken at <hi>Peryn,</hi> was brought to the General, being a Duplicate of thoſe Letters taken at <hi>Padstow,</hi> (another Veſſell being newly landed there out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> not knowing but that it was ſtill in the Kings hand) and that evening was <hi>Peryn</hi> poſſeſt by our Foot, who were received with much joy by the Townes people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday</hi> 17. Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Ingoldsbey</hi> (a ſtout and valiant man) going to view <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſhot from ſome of the Enemies Muſquetteers behind the Mud-walls, of which he dyed within three hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> The General went to view <hi>Pendennis,</hi> and poſſeſſed <hi>Pennycome-Quick;</hi> alſo <hi>Dennis</hi> Fort with twenty ſix pieces of Ordnance, and thirty barrels of Powder was the ſame day ſurrendred to the General; and <hi>Penſans</hi> and Saint <hi>Ives</hi> ſtood upon their guards againſt <hi>Goring's</hi> Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday,</hi> Above an hundred men came with their Armes from <hi>Michael's Mount,</hi> and tendred themſelves to ſerve in the Army.</p>

                  <hi>FRiday</hi> the 10. The General came before <hi>Barnsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Summoned the Towne, and received a civill Anſwer from the Governour, inclining to a Treaty; which began the next day, and held all that day, and part of the day following, which was the <hi>Lords day,</hi> (when it was concluded, much upon the ſame Articles in effect with thoſe of <hi>Excester</hi>) and the Caſtle and the Towne was delivered into our hands, as a ſecurity for ſurrender of the Fort at eight dayes end; Colonel <hi>Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>

               <p>Upon the concluding of <hi>Barnstable</hi> Articles, two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot were commanded from before <hi>Barnsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to martch to <hi>Dunster,</hi> and to face the Caſtle, whileſt the General's Summons was ſent in to the Governour; who embraced a Treaty: and after ſome time ſpent in capitulations, Surrendred the Caſtle to Colonell <hi>Blake.</hi>

                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 13. The General ſet his face toward <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> deſirous to have been there to have ſeen their martching forth, that the Articles might not be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the weather proved ſo unreaſonable wet, that he came ſhort: But ſuch was the vigilancy of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General and the Officers, and indeed ſuch was the temper of the Army, that there was not the leaſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Articles.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Narration of <hi>Excester</hi> with the commemoration of the great diligence, faithfulneſſe and induſtry of Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller,</hi> who being left in truſt by the General (when he martched into <hi>Cornwal</hi>) with the command of the Forces on both ſides of <hi>Excester,</hi> to ſtraiten the Enemy, and hinder them of proviſions, and keep the Enemy from making incurſions into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, performed therein the part of a gallant Gentleman, and an experienced Souldier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday, Wedneſday, Thurſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> the 14, 15, 16, and 17. of <hi>April,</hi> The General ſtayed in <hi>Excester,</hi> ſetled things in order, to the ſafety of that place; and for the eaſe of the Country, and that he might keep his own Army entire for more publick ſervice, reduced three Country Regiments of Foot into one, <hi>viz.</hi> the Regiment
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66403:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Colonel <hi>Shapcoat,</hi> who had done good ſervice at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton,</hi> and the Fort at <hi>Exmouth;</hi> and the Regiment which Colonel <hi>Frye</hi> had very readily raiſed for the then preſent ſervice of the Weſt; and the Regiment of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Weare,</hi> which had been likewiſe imployed in the ſame ſervice. Theſe three Regiments formed into one, was ordered for the defence of the Garriſon of <hi>Excester,</hi> under the command of Colonel <hi>Hamond,</hi> whom the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appointed Governour of the Garriſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday April</hi> 18. The General began his martch toward <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Quartered that night at <hi>Chard</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eighteen miles from <hi>Excester;</hi>) the Foot and Train having had Orders two dayes before to advance forward. Severall Informations came from our Forces before <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> That it was common talk in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that the King would eſcape thence; others ſaid, That he would come into this Army; and others conjectured (that which ſince hath fallen out) That he would goe another way: all care was taken by our Forces thereabouts (as you may well think it concerned them) that this prize, at laſt, might not eſcape them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday</hi> the 19. The General martched to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where moſt of the Army quartered that night: <hi>Monday</hi> the 20. the General martched from <hi>Dorchester</hi> to <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the Traine and Foot to <hi>Blandford:</hi> the Generall ſtayed at <hi>Salisbury, Tueſday, Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the while the Army and Traine of Artillery were come up, and till all that were behind were come up from their ſeverall Quarters: Sundry Complaints were brought thither unto his Excellency, of the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Exceſter</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> Articles by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, of ſeverall Counties, taking from divers their Horſes and Armes, and other neceſſaries, which by the Articles they were to carry away with them: an act of ſo much incivility to the General, as well as injuſtice to the ſufferers, as deſerves to be noted <hi>Nigro Carbone,</hi> but that I know his Excellency deſires not ſuch revenge:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:66403:132"/> But ſo many Barbariſmes of this kind were there, as were they particularly related, would make ſuch a Volume, as would ſcarce be imagined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> the 24. Part of the Army martched to <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> whither the General alſo purpoſed to have gone that night; but Providence ordered it otherwiſe, detaining him at <hi>Salisbury</hi> till next morning, and then he went to <hi>Andover,</hi> where the head Quarter was that night: Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General <hi>Cromwel</hi> was two or three dayes before gone for <hi>London,</hi> at the Generals deſire, to give the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament an account of the ſtate of the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> which God had now ſo happily reduced to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26. The General reſted at <hi>Andover,</hi> where he received the newes that <hi>Woodſtock</hi> was ſurrendred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Treaty, unto Colonel <hi>Rainsborow,</hi> who had gallantly attempted it by ſtorme ſome few dayes before, wherein he received ſome loſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 27. The General martched to <hi>Newbery,</hi> where the next day he received Intelligence of the Kings being eſcaped out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a diſguiſed manner, with his Lock cut off, or tyed up at leſt, his Beard ſhaved, and in the habit of a Serving-man,

The King on the other hand was as little to be wrought upon, to addreſſe himſelf to his Parliament, the iſſue wherof was that precipitate reſolution and diſpoſall of himſelf, as is related before. And now O <hi>England</hi> take up a Lamentation over your King, that to all his Errors he ſhould contract ſuch obſtinacy and irreconcilable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt his Parliament, and that he ſhould be ſo farre miſtaken as while he ſeeks to avoyd the ſurmized prejudice and diſhonour, of referring himſelfe to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to run himſelfe on a reall diſhonour in ſeeking a ſhadow under their Servants: Unhappy greatneſſe, that Priviledges Kings from hearing of their faults plainly as meaner men, and ſplits them on the ſhelfe of ſelf-willed obſtinacy, rather then it wil ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or acknowledge them. But tis not my work to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment but to relate, onely to ſet a character on the integrity of this Army. I have ſaid thus much; it may be thought too much niceneſſe and ſcrupuloſity in them to refuſe ſuch a proffer, but whoſoever ſhall conſider what is hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt approve of their doing; if others had done the like, they had done but their duty.</p>

Being that day twelve-moneth that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my firſt martched into the Field, the General with his Army came before <hi>Oxford</hi> (wherein was Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and a great part of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi>) with intention to ſit downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and lay Siege to it. The Army was drawne to a Randezvouz between <hi>Abington</hi> and <hi>Garſington;</hi> the head Quarter was that night at <hi>Garſington:</hi> At the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz Major-general <hi>Skippon,</hi> who ever ſince the Battle at <hi>Naſeby</hi> had laine under the cure of his wounds, and had ſuffered divers inciſions, by reaſon of a piece of Armour which was lodged in the wound, being now (by the bleſſing of God) well recovered, came to the Army, and was received with much joy, and many accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 2. There was a generall Randezvouz of the Army, Horſe and Foot, upon <hi>Burlington-Green,</hi> and thence the Forces were diſtributed to ſeverall Quarters, to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66403:133"/> at <hi>Heddington, Marston,</hi> and the Townes thereabouts.</p>
               <p>The third of <hi>May,</hi> The General with the Officers of the Army, took a ſurvey of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which they found to have received many materiall alterations and additions of advantage ſince their laſt being before it; &amp; though it was alwayes juſtly accounted a place of great ſtrength, yet now it was made incomparably more ſtrong then ever; [which is very eaſie to be beleeved, if you doe but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, It had been from the beginning of the Warres the King's head Quarter and Garriſon, his chiefe place of reſidence and retreat, where his Counſel, and moſt of the Nobility that had left the Parliament attended him: its place being almoſt in the Center of the Kingdome, gave it no ſmall advantage for the ſending out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon any deſigne. Beſides that, it was ſurrounded about with many ſmall Garriſons of the Kings, as <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, Farrington, Wallingford, Sherborn-houſe, Borstal,</hi> which were as ſo many out-works unto it;] the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in reference to the ground it ſtood upon, rendred it very apt for defence, being placed betwixt the two Rivers <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Charwel;</hi> upon the weſt ſide of it ran ſeverall Branches of the River <hi>Iſis,</hi> ſome of which running cloſe by the Towne wals, was a great defence to it; upon the Eaſt ſide ran the River <hi>Charwel,</hi> which by making Locks at <hi>Clements</hi> Bridge, they had cauſed to overflow the Medowes, ſo that round the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the extent of three parts of it (all except the north ſide, that was ſomewhat higher ground) was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, and abſolutely unapproachable: To this the Line about the City (newly finiſhed) they found to be very high, having many ſtrong Bulworks ſo regularly flanking one another, that nothing could be more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done: round about the Line, both upon the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and the Curtin, was ſtrongly ſet with ſtorm-poles; upon the out-ſide of the Ditch round the Line, it was ſtrongly Palliſadoed, and without that againe, were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſeverall pits in the ground, that a ſingle Foot-man
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66403:134"/> could not without difficulty approach the brink of the Ditch: within the Towne there was five thouſand good Foot, moſt of them of the King's old Infantry, which ſerved him from the beginning of the Wars, and withall they were well ſtored with a plentifull Magazine of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, Ammunition and Proviſions for War; in a word, whatever art or induſtry could doe to make a place im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, was very liberally beſtowed here. All which ſtrength being apprehended and conſidered by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he concluded, that this was no place to be taken at a running pull, but likely rather to prove a buſineſſe of time, hazard and induſtry: Whereupon, at a Counſel of Warre at <hi>Heddington,</hi> it was reſolved to fix our Quarters: our firſt Quarter to be upon <hi>Heddington</hi> Hill, where was ordered to be made a very large and great Work, or Intrenchment, of capacity to receive and lodge three thouſand men: as alſo, that a Bridge ſhould be laid over the River <hi>Charwel</hi> cloſe by <hi>Marston,</hi> that another Quarter might be gone in hand withall between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, wherein it was intended moſt of our Foot ſhould be lodged, that being all the ground we had to approach on: Warrants were ſent out unto the Country round about for Spades, Pick-axes, &amp;c. for that purpoſe; as alſo, a Letter to the Committee for the Army to haſten more Ammunition, with all Requiſites for the Siege, as Tents for Souldiers, &amp;c. from <hi>London:</hi> Which were no ſooner come from thence, but the great Work upon <hi>Heddington</hi> Hill was inſtantly falne in hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and finiſhed in three or four dayes time, to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſouldiers being paid ſo much by the rod for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereat: This Work was committed to Major-General <hi>Skippon.</hi> In the meane time, the Bridge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was made over the River <hi>Charwel,</hi> neer <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> where another Quarter was poſſeſſed, and a Line drawn from <hi>Iſis</hi> to <hi>Charwel,</hi> and a great Work made on that ſide the Water: Colonel <hi>Rainsborough</hi> commanded this Work, there was a third under the command of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66403:134"/> Colonel <hi>Lambert,</hi> the fourth of Colonel <hi>Herbert;</hi> and a Line was begun to be drawn from the great Fort on <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> Hill over againſt Saint <hi>Clements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The management and carrying on of theſe Works, Lines and Approaches, was recommended to the care and skill of Major-general <hi>Skippon,</hi> who went through the ſame with much dexterity.</p>
               <p>By the intelligence of divers that came out of the City his Excellency was further ſatisfied and confirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Enemies great ſtrength within, and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for to hold out.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the ſeverall Poſts were aſſigned to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſeverall Forces were taken forth and deſigned for the blocking up of other Garriſons, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome for <hi>Farringdon,</hi> under the command of Colonel Sir <hi>Robert Pye;</hi> others for <hi>Radcot,</hi> under the command of Colonel <hi>Cook;</hi> and others for <hi>Wallingford,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonel <hi>Paine,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Barkeſtend</hi> on <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> ſide, and Colonel <hi>Temple</hi> on <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> ſide: others for <hi>Borſtal-houſe;</hi> and as many Horſe as could be ſpared were ſent towards <hi>Worceſter,</hi> for the ſtraitning of that garriſon, till ſuch time as the Army were at liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thither: An account of all which ſeverally ſhall be given in due place.</p>

                  <hi>Banbury,</hi> once a great and faire Market-Towne before the late troubles (but now having ſcarce the one halfe ſtanding to gaze on the ruines of the other) was ever till now unfortunate in all meanes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed for its recovery, having laine under the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and tyranny of the Enemy from the beginning, without almoſt any intermiſſion, which happened to it partly through the commodiouſneſſe of its ſcituation for the Enemie, as lying but eighteene miles North from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in ſuch a convenient place as gave it a command into divers other Counties, viz. <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66403:135"/> Warwickeſhire,</hi> &amp;c. from out of which it gathered large contributions for <hi>Oxford;</hi> The ſweetneſſe that the Enemy taſted in the fruits and effects they reaped by this Garriſon, made them, that upon all our attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, they ſtill were ready with great Forces to relieve it: But yet I cannot but alſo look upon, and obſerve therein, a ſpeciall hand and intimation of God againſt that profeſſing place, where in a manner judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, as at the Houſe of God, and was removed with one of the laſt, I pray God ſanctifie it to them.</p>
               <p>The ſtrange ſights that were ſeen over that Towne ſixteen yeers agoe, in the night time, when as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of fighting, pikes puſhing one againſt another, was diſcerned in the Ayre, &amp;c. whereof I was an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with many others, might portend the ſad fate that hath ſince befallen that miſerable place, and the parts thereabouts.</p>
               <p>The Forces imployed in the reducing of that place were about 1000 Foot, and ſome four Troops of Horſe, all under the command of that approved Gentleman Colonel <hi>Whaley:</hi> They lay eleven weeks before the Caſtle; ſo ſoon as they came before it, they entrencht themſelves by a Line drawn round the Towne, for their better ſecurity from any force without: which done, they ſapt up towards the Caſtle, ran over ſeverall Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, over the outmoſt Mote, and ſo wrought into the Enemies Works; the Enemy countermining them, ſprang one Mine upon them, but through Gods mercy did no great hurt; and alſo flinging downe ſtones upon them, and hand Granadoes amongſt them, rendred their duty very hard and hazardous; yet through the goodneſſe of God, and the courage of the Souldiers, we wrought ſo farre into the Enemies Works, as put them out of all hopes of keeping the Caſtle, which conſtrained them to a parley and ſurrender of the Caſtle, Armes, Ordnance, Ammunition and Victuals, upon theſe enſuing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.

               <p>Our Commiſſioners endeavoured to perſwade them the vanity of any ſuch deſire, and the Generals impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of any ſuch delay, adviſing them rather to take the preſent opportunity, leaſt they afterwards fell ſhort of theſe termes they might now have by preſent compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>John Mounſon</hi> and Maſter <hi>Warwick</hi> (it ſeems) were ſo bound up and limited in their Commiſſions, that at preſent, they could not undertake any thing in anſwer hereto, but returning to <hi>Oxford,</hi> took time till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, promiſing more then.

               <p>Whereupon, that what time would be loſt that way, might be ſaved the other, all things went on for the ſiege, the diſpatch of the Line was haſtened, and order was given for the drawing up of the Batteries.</p>
               <p>The ſame day Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and with him neere an hundred Horſe, went forth of <hi>Oxford</hi> on Colonel <hi>Rainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough's</hi> ſide, to take the aire; (Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> riding without Boots, only in his Shoos and Stockings) a Party of our men martched up towards them, and fired upon them; in which skirmiſh Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had a ſhot in the right ſhoulder (but pierced no bone) whereupon they retreated to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where all ſorts were very buſie that day and the two following dayes, conſulting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66403:145"/> Paſſes made after the forementioned Forces were gone, as by a particular Liſt of every mans name was reckoned, whereof many were Noblemen, Knights and Gentlemen of quality, the reſt Officers and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and ſome Schollers. Likewiſe after his Excellency had the Garriſon, the three Regiments of Auxiliaries, conſiſting of two thouſand men, were diſbanded, and their Armes brought in: Thoſe that martched out upon <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> about nine hundred of them laid down their Armes when they came to <hi>Tame,</hi> and received Paſſes to goe to their ſeverall Houſes, and their Armes were brought into <hi>Oxford:</hi> One thouſand one hundred of them liſted themſelves for Forraigne ſervice. There were found in the Magazine ſeventy Barrels of Powder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they had two Mils which ſupplied them daily with Powder. There were in the Towne thirty eight pieces of Ordnance, whereof twenty ſix were Braſſe: For proviſions of Victuals, by what was found in the Stores, and by what was informed they had in the Stores before they ſold it to the Towneſmen, during the Treaty, to raiſe Moneys to pay their Souldiers, there was not leſſe then ſix moneths proviſions. The Souldiers were much diſcontented, and much ado there was to keep them from doing violence to the Lords, for no other cauſe but for being the occaſion, as they ſaid, of delivering up the Towne; a fault which alas they could not help; the ſtrength of the Works about the Towne was found to be ſuch, as reſolved it in the minds of all underſtanding men, to be much for the Parliaments ſervice that the town was taken by conditions, eſpecially conſidering what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable weather followed; that if the Siege had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but to the day of ſurrender, we muſt have been forced to have quit ſome of our leaguers, the fields being overflown with water. The Citizens were provided till Chriſtmas with Proviſions, and did make no queſtion but of Corne, Beef, Bacon, Salt, Butter and Cheeſe, there was plenty for the ſaid time: freſh meat for the great
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66403:145"/> ones, being the onely thing complained of as a want, and yet was found ſome ſtore of that at the ſurrender.</p>

                     <p>The Reſolves of the Counſel were, firſt, That there were four thouſand Foot and three hundred Horſe, by their beſt intelligence, in that Garriſon for Defence.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond was, That they might hold out ſix months
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66403:148"/> before they wanted proviſions of Victuall and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
                     <p>The third was, That it was not adviſeable to ſtorme <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth was, That the moſt probable way was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it by approaches, in caſe they could not cloſe by Treaty.</p>
                     <p>The City now appearing in this Reputation of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derableneſſe, we ſhall look over into particulars of its ſtrength, Souldiery, Ammunition and Victuals.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſtrength of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> For its ſtrength, it was ſurrounded on all ſides, but the North, with Rivers and Meadowes overflowne, ſo as it was onely approachable on the North ſide; and this way was onely approved on by the Counſel of Warre, and yet this way there were two Lines and Works, which in Reaſons of Warre would have ſtood in no little coſt and Blood; for againſt every Port of the ſecond Line, were Colleges (which however once pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Books and Peace, yet now ſerved as petty Caſtles of defence;) which thing was worthy to be conſidered, not ſo much out of tenderneſſe to them, or indulgency to the Blood of this Army, but out of providence to the Kingdome, whoſe Guard it was: As for them, it is well knowne they were never ſuch Huſbands of their Blood, when the State ſtood in need of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſtore of Ammunition.</note> For Ammunition and Victuall, it was well ſtored, there being Amunition which well huſbanded might have ſerved them ſix moneths, and Victual for as long (ſo as themſelves and their Artillery would have both lived and determined together.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The numbers of Souldiers very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> For the Souldiery, there wanted no numbers for that buſineſſe, four thouſand, according to the beſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (and as afterward by paſſes did appeare) above three thouſand, beſide Reformadoe, Scholars, Towneſ-men; who, though a Miſcellany, yet would all have been men of Warre, and of one profeſſion in a time of defence.</p>

                     <p>And beſide all this, we had the name and reputation of the Governour Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham</hi> to take in, who hath been knowne into places, that had been otherwiſe of a dejected fortune, to put life and ſpirit; witneſſe his performance at <hi>York,</hi> which (after the totall routing of the Kings Army before the wals of that City) being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered by the three Generals, with greateſt advantage poſſible, ſtepping immediately from the Victory to the Leaguer, he yet defended till he obtained honourable conditions.</p>
                     <p>And after that deſpaired of no leſſe at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> where he endured ten moneths ſiege, ſubmitti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So as according to this account, conſider what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time and blood would have iſſued in carrying on the approaches for the reducement by force; <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> being a moneth they might very well have reached unto, which muſt neceſſarily have engaged the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo much winter, water, cold and difficulty, as that the iſſue might (in reaſon of Warre) have proved as ſad for the Beſiegers, all things conſidered, as for thoſe in the City; three moneths time would have been the leaſt; and when all things had been ripe for enforcing, the hazard of how many honeſt, gallant men againſt earth and wals, againſt Lines and Colleges?</p>
                     <p>But ſurely we flow not ſo with good men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that we ſhould be ſo indifferently prodigall of thoſe we have, if Victories may be purchaſed cheaper, and at an eaſier rate, beſide the ſpoyle and firing of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and it may be, of that famous Library, which how it would have ſtood with the Reputation of this State, to deſtroy places of Arts ſo freely, let others judge.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grounds of concluding the Treaty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> A Treaty therefore being judged the beſt and moſt counſelable way, His Excellency and the Commiſſioners reſolved to enforce it, and that not onely in reſpect to the Army upon the forementioned conſiderations of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66403:149"/> difficulty, danger and tediouſneſſe of other wayes, but alſo with reference to the State of the Kingdome, and divers other conſiderations. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in relation to the many other Garriſons of the Enemy yet unreduced, as <hi>Worcester, Wallingford, Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Farringdon, Borstall,</hi> with divers others, which did all beare up in the exiſtence and being of this, and were linked to this, as to the Head and Garriſon-royall of all the Enemies, that like members of one body, they could not but live and dye together, ſo as this Cities ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would ſhake all the other into a Treaty, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of this, would take in the reſt, being all threded upon one ſtring of dependency.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Negotiations of the King in Forraigne parts for aſſiſtance, particularly in <hi>France,</hi> as is cleer by the <hi>French</hi> Agent, who received his Majeſty firſt in his Quarters, and Negotiated with him at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and by <hi>Aſhburnham's</hi> diſpatch into <hi>France</hi> (notwithſtanding the Parliaments demand of him) all which put together (though we would rather quench then cheriſh any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of ſuch a Neighbour State) yet it cannot but be judged well beſeeming his Excellency and his Counſell, wiſely to provide, and put caſes of things to come, and occur and prevent (if it may be) dangers poſſible, being well aſſured we deale with an Enemy, who hath loſt neither Wit, Friends, Activity nor Reſolution, to play his Game once more over, if he knew at what Card to begin.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſuſpitions and jealouſies that were kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling towards ſome in our Brethrens Army, upon the ſodaine Alarum of his Majeſties reception there, and ſome other paſſages from the North; not that the Army did conclude a doubt or ſuſpition of them, but rather haſten to be upon ſuch a free and ſtrong intereſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement, as might ſooner put all things into better correſpondency, while both Armies are fairly at liberty in their owne intereſts, and upon equall bottomes,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66403:149"/> whereby a third deſigning party (I meane the Kings) might not work upon the inequality of the other two; Temptation and Opportunity being the worſt Enemies that honeſt men have.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Treaty in <hi>Ireland</hi> for a peace with thoſe there, and to make that peace a way of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tage over for ſome new ſupplies into <hi>England;</hi> which though then was but by divine intelligence diſcerned, yet now things are cleerer and more certaine.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the arming the Parliament with a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged Army (as came to paſſe by the ſurrender of this City) ſo as now they might treat or capitulate, as a Kingdome upon its owne intereſt and bottome, with the more honour, and with no more condiſcention, then love and juſtice would perſwade them; ſurely they that know the difference betwixt a State, attended on by a free and entire Army in times of deſigne and diſtraction and beginnings of ſettlement, and betwixt a State ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by broken Regiments, and an engaged Force or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot judge the freeing and diſingaging this Army ſo ſoon from the attendance of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to a meere atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the State in a time of ſuch high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be leſſe then a Counſel both of neceſſity and of advancement to the Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>And now I ſhall fairly remove ſome Objections, which may be moats in the eyes of ſome, and hinder their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fairneſſe of this proceeding.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that of permitting excepted perſons to goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed; but I cannot grant this Objection ſo farre, that they did goe unpuniſhed, unleſſe all juſtice and righteouſneſſe runne downe onely in the blood of the Offender: Indeed the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fought by ſuch Lawes againſt the Nations, as in the caſe of <hi>Agag;</hi> but how farre ſuch Lawes are rules to the State of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are not under that judiciall policy and ſpeciall precepts, I leave to be diſputed: but ſurely thoſe ſix excepted perſons went not unpuniſhed, they received
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66403:150"/> loſſe of all (one of them an Eſtate worth an hundred thouſand pounds) and if yet nothing but life be juſtice, they loſt that too; I meane, their life in this Kingdome, being never more to live in this State, ſo as in a manner they are dead to us, though not unto themſelves; nor could their life be ſo eaſily come at, without the loſſe of many, it may be, more deare and precious; and had the approaches and ſtorme gone on, who can undertake thoſe few, thoſe ſix excepted perſons, might not have eſcaped? and then how had this aſſay of juſtice ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? ſurely juſtice is not all of one colour, all purple, there is puniſhment by baniſhment, and confiſcation as well as death; and ſuppoſe after the loſſe of many an honourable ſpirit to purchaſe ſix men, they had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and delivered up, there are wayes of eſcape from States as well as Armies.</p>
                     <p>For that other Objection of the exemption from the Oath or Covenant for ſix moneths; why ſhould it be a crime to his Excellency now, which was none to the Lieutenant-General of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, who at <hi>Carliſle</hi> granted that Article, <hi>To be excepted from any Oath whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> (as by referring to the ſaid Articles may appear) and our General grants but an exemption for ſix moneths; how is it that offences are more fairly interpreted in <hi>Scotch</hi> then <hi>Engliſh?</hi> And it is not amiſſe to conſider <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> once a Garriſon of the Enemies, yet ſurrendred upon honourable conditions, to the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> his Excellency, then General, <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Redding</hi> differing but in three things: Firſt, <hi>Oxford</hi> was more conſiderable and <hi>Redding</hi> leſſe: ſecondly, the Delinquents of <hi>Redding</hi> martched out of the Towne, and thoſe of <hi>Oxford</hi> out of the Kingdome: thirdly, <hi>Redding</hi> had but four Barrels of Powder when they capitulated, <hi>Oxford</hi> a plentifull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe things, I wonder how any can find fault with this Army or Souldiery, for diſpatch of their work ſo ſoon; and never till now (and now by what Law I
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66403:150"/> know not) was it an offence to have Warre ſoon ended? Let me aſke what hath this Army done ill in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Hath it not done juſtice upon Offenders? it may be not juſtice of our very faſhion, according to ſuch a very patterne of ſome, becauſe they could not conquer juſt by a rule, but as neceſſity of State and Warre would ſuffer them: Hath this Army by this ſurrender failed of that plunder and rich ſpoile they might have had in the ſtorme? This was a fault wherein the Souldiery were more conſcionable then covetous: and me thinks we ſhould eaſily pardon them in this, That they had rather end the Warre to the Kingdomes, then their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>Hath this Army by this ſurrender been more free, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and at liberty, to guard both State and Parliament? me thinks this ſhould be onely the griefe of our Enemies not of our Friends.</p>
                     <p>Hath this Army by this ſurrender brought in ſo many other Garriſons, as follo in this Story, &amp;c? ſurely ſuch wayes of fighting as leave the Enemy ſcarce an intereſt in the Kingdome, is a new kind of failing, and an offence not heard of till our times, wherein ingratitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are by too many thought good pay for greateſt ſervices.</p>
                     <p>Hath this Army by this ſurrender and diſingagement, awed and affrighted the gatherings of new Parties to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the old? this is indeed a miſchief; but to whom? even to every one that is not a lover of the Kingdomes ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Hath this Army by a ſpirit more Almighty then their owne, brought home an Olive to this State, after ſuch overflowings of War and Blood, and ſhall not the Dove be taken into the Arke? ſhall there be no preſervation for them that preſerve others?</p>

               <p>AFter the Surrender of <hi>Banbury</hi> Caſtle, Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> was ſent with ſome few Troops of Horſe to <hi>Worcester,</hi> for the better keeping in of the Enemy; Colonel <hi>Morgan</hi> who was before ſuch time attending that ſervice with the <hi>Glocesterſhire</hi> Forces, was ordered by the General to <hi>Ragland,</hi> to command in chiefe thoſe Forces that ſhould be imployed for the reducing of that place, if upon the Summons ſent into <hi>Worcester</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſtood off and would not treat; which accordingly falling out, the Enemy in <hi>Worcester</hi> returning a very high and preſumptory Anſwer upon the Summons that was ſent into them, and making higher demands then were granted to <hi>Oxford.</hi> Colonel <hi>Morgan</hi> according to his Orders, martched to <hi>Ragland,</hi> leaving Colonel <hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> (to attend the ſervice before <hi>Worcester</hi>) who with the Forces of the Counties of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> together with ſome Forces of <hi>Newport-pagnel, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> lay before it, ſo as to keep off reliefe and hinder the Enemy from getting in proviſions from the Country: But there was a great want of Foot for a regular and cloſe Siege, which when the ſervice of <hi>Oxford</hi> was over, and that Garriſon ſurrendred, was inſtantly ſupplyed, Colonel <hi>Rainsborough</hi> being ſent with a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade thither, who no ſooner came before the Towne, but he laid his Foot Quarters cloſe to the Enemies Works, and in two or three nights (according to much judgment and reſolution) raiſed a Work, which much annoyed the Enemies great Fort: whereupon they came to a capitulation, and being much diſtracted with the ſurrender of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and fearing if they neglected their opportunity, they ſhould have no conditions at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the whole power of the Army to come upon them, They came to conditions as followeth:</p>

               <p>About ten dayes before which a Summons was ſent them, but they, in hope of Reliefe by Ships from Saint <hi>Mallowes,</hi> returned a deniall; and after thoſe Ships were by contrary windes beaten to <hi>Morleys,</hi> yet the Enemy perſiſted in his obſtinacy, expecting a propitious blaſt to bring their Reliefe to them; nor could the fate of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Worcester</hi> and <hi>Litchfield</hi> ſurrendred, comming to their eares, work them to any other reſolution then to hold out, without his Majeſties ſpeciall Warrant to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, whom the Governour was very earneſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine liberty to ſend unto; or if not to the King, at leſt to the Prince, and would faine have perſwaded Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> to condiſcend thereto, as but a common curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but could not prevaile, he not underſtanding it ſo: by a Lieutenant of ours, whom Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed another of theirs for, he underſtood that a Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop had gone forth about the 26 of <hi>July</hi> to the Prince his Highneſſe, to certifie him of their condition, unable to hold out many dayes without Reliefe.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Batten</hi> kept ten large Boats and Barges well manned, before the mouth of the Harbour every night, within command of the caſtle, drawing them off in the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66403:160"/> morning: One morning when he was newly drawne off, a Shallop got in by ſtealth, which cauſed great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the Caſtle; but 'twas conceived (and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> was ſo informed by good hands) that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reliefe was in it, ſave a Hogs-head or two of Wine.</p>
               <p>Some Overtures were made to the Enemy within, to goe for <hi>Flanders,</hi> an Agent from the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> came for that purpoſe, deſiting to ſpeak with ſome of the Souldiers in the Caſtle, while ſome of ours ſhould be by; which being granted, he made an Overture to ſome Papiſt Officers of entertainment in the King of <hi>Spaine's</hi> ſervice in <hi>Flanders;</hi> they deſired to be ſatiſfied of the Agents authority, and to ſee the conditions; which being readily condiſcended unto and performed on the Agents part, they anſwered him, That at preſent they were engaged, but ſhould they be once free, next to their preſent Maſter they would ſerve his Majeſty of <hi>Spaine:</hi> This curteſie was taken well from Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> by the Enemy and the Agent; and certainly any thing belonging meerly to civility, without invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving danger in its conſequence, was never denied by him.</p>
               <p>The Enemy in the Caſtle kept fires all night, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to any Reliefe that ſhould make towards them. They were very prodigall of their powder, making two hundred great ſhot in the ſpace of three dayes at our men, but without any great execution, only three of our men being ſlaine thereby: The Work of keeping them in ſo ſtraitly from Reliefe, was very great, and was not performed without very hard duty to our Souldiers, the Enemy within being ſo numerous, which therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds as much to the honour of the Beſiegers: and Captaine <hi>Batten</hi> with his Ships by Sea was no leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vigilant, though indeed he wanted Shallops and Pinaces for the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Some dayes after the forementioned Shallop, there
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66403:161"/> came in another to the Caſtle, but it was conceived not much more Reliefe in that then in the former, and that becauſe the Governour ſent about the ſame time a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Colonel <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> to know if he had power to treat with him, and whether he could make good the conditions he ſhould grant; alleaging, that otherwiſe it would be a diſhonour to him to treat, and the agreement to be contradicted by any other: Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer, He had power to treat and to make good the agreement: Whereupon the Governour took two dayes time to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The time appointed for the Treaty to begin was <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Auguſt</hi> 10. when accordingly the Commiſſioners on both ſides met, the Enemy making his demands, ours offering their propoſitions, which held them till <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> noon, when their Commiſſioners brake off, and went away in great diſcontent at the tearmes that were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; but on <hi>Friday</hi> 14. the winds were laid, and the the Treaty (by Colonel <hi>Forteſcue's</hi> art) came on againe, and by <hi>Saturday</hi> night the 15. all was concluded, ſave the time of ſurrender, which was agreed the next day, and the Articles ſigned, which were as followeth.</p>

               <p>It is a place of great ſtrength, the Tyde flowing about it twice a day, which rendred the reduction of it a ſervice of great difficnlty and conſequence, and Redoun ding much to the honour of Colonel <hi>Hamond,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the ſame; whoſe Merits alſo in that ſingular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſetling Quarters on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Excester</hi> at Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpitall, &amp;c. within halfe Musket-ſhot of the Enemy; afterwards martching to <hi>Torrington</hi> with his Regiment, deſerves a ſpeciall note to be put upon it.</p>

               <p>And thus yon have a <hi>true</hi> (though plaine and briefe) account of the <hi>Actions</hi> of this <hi>Army,</hi> which God <hi>reſerved</hi> for ſuch a time as our <hi>loweſt</hi> eſtate, when his <hi>ſeaſon</hi> was to deliver us.

               <p>And now there being no Enemy either in Field or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, his Excellency after ſowe ſmal time of refreſhment and reſt from his continuall wearineſſe and action, was by the Parliament Ordered from <hi>Oxford</hi> into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> there to disband Major-General <hi>Maſſies</hi> Brigade; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accordingly he immediately martched, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Devizes,</hi> where in the ſpace of eight dayes, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency disbanded the whole Brigade, conſiſting of two thouſand five hundred Horſe; whom (to give them their due) he found for the moſt part, <hi>prepared</hi> to obey the Ordinance of Parliament; which was the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, in reſpect that of many moneths Arreares which were behind, they received but ſix weeks pay, which yet is not wholly to be reckoned to the <hi>ingenuity</hi> of the men, but in a great part to the <hi>carefulneſſe</hi> and prudence of Major-General <hi>Maſſie,</hi> Colonel <hi>Cook,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Officers:</hi> Divers of the Disbanded come from very <hi>remote</hi> Countries, and had Paſſes ſome for <hi>Egypt,</hi> others for <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Aethyopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This work was no ſooner over, but it pleaſed God to viſit the <hi>General</hi> with a ſore fit of the <hi>Stone:</hi> Saint

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66403:166"/> have taken the Dimenſions of the largeſt Coronts and Trophies wherewith they are made Glorious, and even thoſe would rather ſtraighten then enlarge the Temples of yours Excellency; or elſe I ſhould have conſulted ſome of the moſt Learned and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oratours, who have ſet forth the glorious <hi>Geſts</hi> performed in former times, whereby I might have inſisted on ſome <hi>Paralell</hi> for your <hi>Wiſdome, Piety, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Valour;</hi> but I conceive the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Succeſſe which God hath bestowed upon you, were very hardly to be matcht, and rather needed more <hi>Induſtry</hi> and Memory to <hi>Enumerate,</hi> then <hi>Oratory</hi> to <hi>Poliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heretofore when I read the Histories of the Acts of famous Princes and Warrious, in this or other Nations, it was not without ſome <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> that in them there was ſome mixture and gloſſes of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Art, the more to ſet off, and give Lustre to the Acts, as Arguments of Emulation, for others to follow the Foot-ſteps of their Vertues; but the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your Excellency will adde Lnstre and Beliefe to them, being all verified in you: And (indeed) here, conſidering the ſwift Martches, and the Ex peditions in theſe grand and difficult Attempts, which were proſecuted and effected by your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, I may ſay, <hi>The Almighty came Riding on the Wings of the Wind,</hi> for theſe were nothing elſe but the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> acted in and by you his Instrument.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And ſurely the Honour of the late Lord General was not, whiles he lived, any way eclipſed by the ſucceſſion of your Excellency in his Command, but rather augmented, whiles each retained the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne Honour, having both Rayes enough to enlighten a Kingdome, then overſet with Clouds and thick darkneſſe.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Firſt, of the <hi>General</hi> Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX.</head>
               <p>I Shall here paſſe over his Extraction, Education and contract, as having been toucht upon before, and now to begin with him as General, which He began to be in as little a copy and proportion as hath been knowne, ſetting out with an Army ſcarce large enough for his title; ſo as he began as all true naturall growths and encreaſings, from ſeeds and ſmall beginnings, and ſo grew up more naturally then artificially into compleatneſſe, rather by providence then violence, rather by courſe then wonder; as if God rather then men ſhould make him and his Army grow.</p>
               <p>His way of ſteerage and conduct at firſt, was amongſt men in reputation for Religion, as if the beſt place he could find for counſel and action was there where God was; and he proſpered accordingly, as if Providence would let him ſee, there is the beſt <hi>Policy</hi> where there is the beſt <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He wanted one thing, and yet had the more by ſuch a want; and that was a Privado or Favourite of paſſion, as if providence had intended him for <hi>men,</hi> and therefore would keep him from <hi>man:</hi> Men were rather his <hi>Friends</hi> then his <hi>Favourites,</hi> and his <hi>Judgment</hi> was rather enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of men, then his <hi>Affections;</hi> Religion and the <hi>Publick</hi> being the beſt lines for great men to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>love</hi> by.</p>
               <p>He never diſcovered paſſions abroad in counſels or actions, what he had at home in himſelf, he (not others) knew; and this was of advantage, both to what was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and what was done; for the buſineſſe of War is beſt managed by peace at home, and thoſe counſels that are leaſt troubled themſelves, bring over moſt trouble to the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66403:170"/> Enemy, and the Steerſman that ſits at Helme, had not need to have the palſie in his hand.</p>
               <p>In counſels for action, he was ever ready to let thoſe reaſons that had moſt appearance of God prevaile; as if he had obſerved <hi>Faith</hi> to be of more ſucceſſe in theſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, then <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His carriage in this Warre hath beene conſtant action, diligence and vigilance, being never leſſe in title, then when any thing was to do, as if to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral raiſed him onely to do more, not to be more then others.</p>
               <p>He was not without love, clemency and meekneſſe, by which he kept his Army leſſe ſtained in the Blood of his Enemy; but not leſſe Victorious; for by this he only drew leſſe blood, but more men to him.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of our <hi>Troubles</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> he was thus farre in <hi>Peace,</hi> that he could beare the <hi>different</hi> opinions in their <hi>unity</hi> to the publick, ſeeing the Work goe on as well as if all had been of one mind, and weighed men (as we hope) by love to God, and to the publick, and by this he kept cleer from daſhing againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>good men,</hi> in pretence of <hi>opinion:</hi> and thus the work hath been done with as much appearance of God, as hath been ſeen in many Ages.</p>
               <p>He was ſtill for action in Field or Fortification, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they would up and be doing; and thus his ſuceeſſe hath run through a line croſſe to that of old Souldiery, of long Sieges and ſlow approaches; and he hath done all ſo ſoon, becauſe he was ever doing.</p>
               <p>For his love to Religion, that is a buſineſſe as well of the heart as of the hand, of power as of forme, and we hope he is that to God that he is to others; if we may judge mens pietie by their practice, he is not wanting in Religious duties, in reading, in exerciſes; but God and not men muſt commend him in this.</p>
               <p>For his perſonage, he is tall, yet not above juſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66403:170"/> proportion, yet taller (as ſome ſay) when he is in the Field, then at home, as if Victory were in his ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, and raiſed him higher then his ordinary ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>His body is not without its infirmities, as of <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Distillations,</hi> which ſometimes cauſe an impediment in his ſpeech: Thus Providence pitches him in a Tent, ſomething crazy, in a Body weakned by War and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that he may live humbly, and know himſelf to be but man in the hands of God, and be a man as well of infirmity as of glory.</p>
               <p>Thus I have writ him over, I hope, in truth to thoſe that know him, but rather for thoſe that know him not but by Pen or Picture, yet with this clauſe, That what is good in him, we may not know to be his owne, but his that gave him it; even his who is the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of all our good.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>THE Officers of this Army, as you may read, are ſuch, as knew little more of War, then our owne unhappy Warres had taught them, except ſome few, ſo as men could not contribute much to this work: Indeed I may ſay this, they were better chriſtians then ſouldiers, and wiſer in faith then in fighting, and could beleeve a Victory ſooner then contrive it; and yet I think they were as wiſe in the way of Souldiery as the little time and experience they had could make them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Officers, many of them with their Souldiery, were much in prayer and reading Scripture, an exerciſe that Souldiers till of late have uſed but little, and thus then went on and proſpered: men conquer better as they are Saints, then Souldiers; and in the countries where they came, they left ſomething of God as well as of <hi>Caeſar</hi> behind them, ſomething of piety as well as Pay.</p>
               <p>They were much in Juſtice upon Offenders, that they might be ſtill in ſome degree of Reformation in their
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66403:171"/> Military ſtate. Armies are too great Bodies to be ſound in all parts at once.</p>
               <p>The Army was (what by example and juſtice) kept in good order, both reſpectively to it ſelfe, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: nor was it their pay that pacified them; for had they not had more civility then money, things had not been ſo fairly managed.</p>
               <p>They were many of them differing in opinion, yet not in action nor buſineſſe; they all agreed to preſerve the Kingdome; they proſpered more in their unity, then uniformity; and whatever their opinions were, yet they plundered none with them, they betrayed none with them, nor diſobeyed the State with them, and they were more viſibly pious and peaceable in their opinions, then many we call more orthodox.</p>
               <p>They were generally conſtant and conſcientious in duties, and by ſuch ſoberneſſe and ſtrictneſſe conquered much upon the vanity and looſneſſe of the Enemy; many of thoſe fought by principle as well as pay, and that made the work goe better on, where it was not made ſo much matter of merchandize as of conſcience: They were little inutinous or diſputing commands; by which peace the Warre was better ended.</p>
               <p>There was much amity and unity amongſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, while they were in action, and in the Field, and no viſible Emulations and Paſſions to break their Ranks, which made the publick fare better. That Boat can goe but ſlowly where the Oares rowe ſeverall wayes; the beſt Expeditions is by things that goe one way.</p>
               <p>The Army was faire in their martches to Friends, and mercifull in Battaile and ſucceſſe to Enemies, by which they got ſome love from Enemies, though more from Friends.</p>
               <p>This Army went on better by two more wheels of Treaſurers and a Committee; the Treaſurers were men of publick ſpirits to the State and Army, and were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ready to preſent ſome pay upon every ſucceſſe,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:66403:171"/> which was like wine after work, and cheered up the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon ſpirit to more activity.</p>
               <p>The Committee which the Houſe of Commons formed, were men wiſe, provident, active and faithfull in providing Ammunition, Armes, Recruits of men, cloathes: And that Family muſt needs thrive that hath good Stewards.</p>
               <p>Thus you have a Copy of our Army; we will not ſay they have no faults, but thoſe they have, we wiſh rather reformed then read by the World.</p>
